    st.write("Imagine a future in drug discovery where decisions are made not by chance, but through precision and data. Introducing PathoGeneMapâ€”a groundbreaking tool that uses AI to navigate the complex landscape of disease-causing genes. The biomedical field is rich with experiments outlining genesâ€™ roles in diseases, yet this critical information is locked away in dense literature. My experience as an MDPhD, manually reviewing 3,000 abstracts for data on just 100 genes, highlights the daunting task researchers face. PathoGeneMap addresses this challenge by leveraging AI to sift through 35 million biomedical papers to present the exact information researchers need. PathoGeneMap empowers researchers worldwide to make informed decisions, accelerating the development of new treatments for patients.")
