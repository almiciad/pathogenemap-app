63316	<TITLE>Carcinoid of the uterine cervix: additional observations on a new tumor entity.</TITLE>Twelve carcinoid tumors of the uterine cervix were studied. Based on the microscopic structure, they were divided into well-differentiated and poorly differentiated types. Both tumor varieties affected adult women. The clinical and gross features of these tumors were indistinguishable from those of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 12 patients, six died, four with poorly differentiated carcinoid and two with the well-differentiated type. Three patients are alive and symptom-free 9 months to 2 years after treatment; the remaining three were lost to follow-up. Microscopically, four well-differentiated carcinoids showed argyrophil cells, and ultrastructurally two had neurosecretory granules. One of the well-differentiated carcinoids resembled islet cell carcinoma and two had areas resembling medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The poorly differentiated type of carcinoid had a histologic structure and a cell population very similar to that of the oat cell carcinoma of the lung. Of this group, four were argyrophilic, and by electron microscopy four contained pleomorphic secretory granules. It is considered that these tumors arise from the normal argyrophil cell of the cervix and are part of the group of neoplasms of the diffuse endocrine cell system (APUD).

67139	<TITLE>Experimental infection with Ancylostoma caninum larvae in mice. IV. Serum protein pattern during primary infection.</TITLE>Serum protein of Swiss albino mice infected with Ancylostoma caninum larvae, were analysed electrophoretically. Twenty mice were infected with a dose of 1000 larvae and the alterations in serum protein during an infection period of 30 days were recorded and compared with uninfected controls. The result showed a significant decrease in albumin and gamma globulin with an increase in beta globulin. There were no significant changes in the alpha-1 and alpha-2 globulins. The total globulins increased and A/G ratio decreased. These changes appeared to be remarkable on the 9th day after infection.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
132671	<TITLE>Copulation in noncopulators: effect of PCPA in male rats.</TITLE>Twenty eight virgin male rats who failed to mount spontaneously on four successive mating tests were randomly assigned to two equal groups. One group received four daily injections of PCPA (100 mg/kg-IP), and the other, four vehicle injections. About 24 hr after the last injection all rats were subjected to a mating test. Eight rats of the PCPA group and only two of the vehicle, started to copulate. The difference is significant at the 0.05 level (two-tail). The 18 rats that did not start to copulate, failed to do so also on a repeated test a week later, and were then given four additional daily injections of PCPA. Sixteen of them started to copulate on the following mating test. Most of the rats copulated successfully on additional mating tests that took place three to eight weeks later, in the absence of further PCPA treatment.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
372447	<TITLE>The effects of organic solvents and temperature on the desorption of yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase from immunoadsorbent.</TITLE>Physicochemical parameters governing the elution of yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase from its immunoadsorbent were studied. Non-denaturing elution conditions were determined (alkali medium containing 50%, v/v, ethylene glycol) and the method was applied to one-step isolation of enzyme from a crude yeast preparation.

419514	<TITLE>Influence of ante- and peri-mortem factors on biochemical and physical characteristics of turkey breast muscle.</TITLE>The course of post-mortem breakdown of glycogen and ATP in turkey pectoralis major muscle was markedly influenced by several ante- and peri-mortem variables. Application of a proper stunning procedure was highly effective in preventing peri- and post-mortem muscle stress reactions. The physiological level of glycogen and ATP was not significantly affected by road transportation covering 260 km. Birds which rested for 24 hrs following transportation had lower glycogen and ATP levels at the moment of slaughter than non-rested birds. According to the changes in the rate and extent of post-mortem biochemical reactions, several meat characteristics such as water-holding capacity, colour, and tenderness were significantly changed. Furthermore, the results also indicate that turkey breast muscle is susceptible to a PSE-like condition as described in pork.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
475978	<TITLE>In vitro prediction of the pathogenicity of mineral dusts.</TITLE>Eight mineral dusts, of which 7 were fibrous, were tested in 3 in vitro systems. The dusts had previously been tested for their ability to produce mesotheliomata in rats. The in vivo and in vitro biological activities of these dusts are compared with the number and size of fibres they contain. It is concluded that all the in vitro systems would predict which dusts are pathogenic in vivo, and that both in vivo and in vitro biological activities are determined by the number of long, fine fibres.

508206	<TITLE>A simple procedure for the assay of brain biogenic amines by selected-ion monitoring: its application to the elucidation of the mechanism of prolactin release induced by 3-iodo-L-tyrosine.</TITLE>A simple method for the assay of brain biogenic amines by selected-ion monitoring was applied to examination of the effects of 3-iodo-L-tyrosine on the hypothalamic-median eminence concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the rat. Thirty minutes after its administration iodotyrosine (50 mg/kg) caused a highly significant (P less than 0.0005) rise in serum prolactin and a highly significant (P less than 0.0025) fall in the concentration of dopamine in the hypothalamus and median eminence where the levels reached 50% of control levels. Less marked but significant falls were also observed in the hypothalamic (P less than 0.05) and median eminence (P less than 0.0025) concentrations of noradrenaline after iodotyrosine administration. Serotonin concentration was significantly reduced (P less than 0.025) in the median eminence but not in the hypothalamus after iodotyrosine administration. These findings suggest that iodotyrosine exerts its prolactin stimulating effect by blockage of dopamine synthesis rather than by receptor blockade.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
512937	<TITLE>The electrogenic potential in rat C nerve fibres: some effects of lithium and thallium.</TITLE>1. Subsequent to bathing a desheathed vagus nerve in a K-free medium Li (5-50 mM) generates a hyperpolarizing response in the same manner as does K except that Li is 23 times less potent than K. Preincubation with small concentrations of either Li or K inhibits a subsequent K response.2. The Li response is less phasic than the K response. In the presence of a cardiac glycoside Li has no effect whereas K depolarizes the preparation. Thus Li is presumed to generate a relatively pure ouabain-sensitive electrogenic response.3. If a Li response is always terminated with 50 mM-Li, but various concentrations are used during the first half, the total response has a constant area despite the wide range of activation during the first half. This implies that the electrogenic pump ratio is constant over this range of activation.4. Thallium (1 mM) also generates a ouabain-sensitive response, but even short exposures (5 min) produces a strong and lasting inhibition of subsequent potassium responses. On a slower time scale Tl also inhibits the electrogenic post-tetanic hyperpolarization. After exposure to Tl a test action potential shows that the afterpotential is also decreased.5. If action potentials are produced during an electrogenic response the hyperpolarizing afterpotential reverses polarity. It is supposed that this is due to a short-circuiting of the electrogenic potential during this time.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
540450	<TITLE>Intralymphocytic sodium in hypertensive patients: a significant correlation.</TITLE>1. Intralymphocytic sodium concentration was measured in 50 patients with essential stable hypertension, 44 patients with labile hypertension and 40 subjects with normal blood pressure. 2. Intralymphocytic sodium concentration in normotensive subjects was significantly lower than in the other two groups. 3. The concentration was significantly correlated with mean blood pressure in the group as a whole and in the groups with stable and with labile hypertension. No correlation was found in normal subjects.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
603230	<TITLE>ABO blood groups and cholera.</TITLE>The ABO blood group of 87 bacteriologically proven cases of cholera and 33 bacteriologically negative cholera-like diarrhoea cases was determined. When compared with the normal blood group distribution in the population of the Philippines of the same racial group to which the patients belonged, a relatively larger number of cases were found to occur in individuals of group O and a lesser number in those of group A. A plea is made for further studies on these lines to explain the host susceptibility in cholera and other acute enterotoxigenic diarrhoeas.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
608143	<TITLE>Cortical thickness measurements and photon absorptiometry for determination of bone quantity.</TITLE>Reproducibility of estimates of cortical bone quantity in the appendicular skeleton by two methods was studied in healthy individuals and patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Repeated measurements of cortical thickness (CT) at the midpoint of the second metacarpal were taken from single radiographs of both hands by two independent observers. Repeated measurements by the same observer were more reproducible and the degree of reproducibility was far greater in healthy subjects than in dialysis patients. Repeated measurements were made of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width (W) of the distal radius by photon absorptiometry. Repeated BMC/W determinations were highly reproducible in both healthy subjects and dialysis patients. High correlation was found between BMC and cross-sectional cortical area and between both simple cortical thickness and cortical area/width. Thus the photon absorptiometric technique is superior for the serial monitoring of bone quantity, particularly in patients with uremic osteodystrophy, but results obtained by the two methods in group studies should be comparable.

679705	<TITLE>Hemisphere differences in the recognition of nonsense shapes: cerebral dominance or strategy effects?</TITLE>A tachistoscopic visual half-field task involving delayed recognition of nonsense shapes did not prove to rely disproportionately on either cerebral hemisphere. However, subjects at either extreme of the laterality distribution were more accurate at recognition overall, relative to subjects displaying indeterminate laterality. These results are discussed in terms of subjects' preferred processing strategies and it is concluded that until we possess a detailed knowledge of task requirements and of subjects' strategies, the results of laterality studies will remain ambiguous.

798058	<TITLE>Epistaxis and the nasostat.</TITLE>The most effective method of treating epistaxis is to identify and cauterize the bleeding vessel. If this cannot be done, other methods must be used. Anterior packs without a choanal plug are not reliable. Gauze posterior packs are traumatic and should not be used. The Foley chatheter with anterior gauze packs is quite satisfactory but the Nasostat, which can also be used with anterior packing when necessary, will, in most cases, control the bleeding without subjecting the patient to the discomfort of nasal packs. In addition, when used properly, it is safe and easily tolerated. The technique and its complications are described.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
814196	<TITLE>The adherence of human Fc receptor-bearing lymphocytes to antigen-antibody complexes. II. Morphologic alterations induced by the substrate.</TITLE>The adhesion of human Fc receptor-bearing lymphocytes to immobilized antigen-antibody complexes is accompanied by marked alterations in cell shape, resulting in flattening of greater than 90% of the adherent cells. In addition, about 65% of the adherent cells become elongated, with distinct uropods being present in about 1/3 of these cells. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that most of the surface microvilli are lost, while ruffled membranes and long microextensions are formed during the shape change. Time-lapse cinematography shows that the major shape changes occur within a few minutes after contact with the substrate, and that the adherent cells undergo translational motility. Both flattening and elongation of the adherent cells are inhibited by low temperature, chelating agents, cytochalasin B, and vinblastine, while sodium azide selectively inhibits elongation and uropod formation. It is argued that these morphological changes result from an active response of the cell to the immobilized complexes, and that such alterations may be related mechanistically to the ability of the cells to kill antibody-coated target cells.

862625	<TITLE>Bioassay and radioimmunoassay of gastrin and significance of gastrin degradation products.</TITLE>Inactivation of gastrin was studied (a) in vitro by incubation with a high-speed supernatant fraction of rat small bowel mucosa and (b) in vivo by perfusing gastrin through the small bowel vascular bed in anaesthetized dogs. In both types of experiment there was a highly significant loss in the bioactivity of gastrin, but no significant change in its immunoreactivity. This showed that gastrin was inactivated by a subtle chemical change which rendered the molecule biologically inactive, yet left its immunoreactivity unimpaired.

894655	<TITLE>A selective approach to outpatient breast biopsy under local anesthesia.</TITLE>Outpatient breast biopsy was recommended for women who had a clinically benign, relatively small, accessible breast mass and for a few women with clinical cancer who would not consent to biopsy and possible mastectomy under general anesthesia. Inpatient biopsy under general anesthesia, with possible immediate mastectomy, was recommended for women who had clinical cancer, a large mass or a mass deep within a large breast, and to a few women psychologically unfit for local anesthesia. The incidence of malignancy was 8% in the 153 outpatients and 45% in the 114 inpatients. The incidence of complications between the two groups was not significantly different. The total cost of inpatient biopsy under general anesthesia was over five times higher than that of outpatient biopsy under local anesthesia. Outpatient breast biopsy is a satisfactory approach for appropriately selected patients.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
945067	<TITLE>The effect of internal urethrotomy and urethral dilatation on the postoperative course of patients undergoing surgery for stress incontinence.</TITLE>Three years' experience of a total of 128 patients undergoing surgery for stress incontinence is described. Forty-three patients had an internal urethrotomy performed routinely at the end of the operation, 26 had routine urethral dilatation and 59 had neither procedure. Internal urethrotomy, and to a lesser extent urethral dilatation, resulted in prompt return of spontaneous and efficient micturition following removal of the Foley catheter on the third postoperative day. The postoperative stay averaged 6-4 days in the urethrotomy group of patients, 7-6 days in those who had urethral dilatation and 10-6 days in the others. The two-year cure rate in the patients who had neither procedure performed was 85 per cent and as yet no failures have occurred in the patients who had internal urethrotomy or urethral dilatation performed.

952785	<TITLE>Treatment and survival in 631 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix.</TITLE>From 1951 to 1972, a total of 631 cases of invasive carcinoma of the cervix were diagnosed in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Denmark. Treatment was either by surgery or radiotherapy, a combination of both being rarely used. The crude five-year survival rates were 99 per cent in stage Ia, 79 per cent in stage Ib, 67 per cent in stage IIa, 45 per cent in stage IIb, 23 per cent in stage III, 5 per cent in stage IV and 63 per cent for all stages. The relative survival rates were respectively 100 per cent, 81 per cent, 73 per cent, 48 per cent, 26 per cent, 5 per cent and 66 per cent. Radical hysterectomy were found more effective than radiotherapy in stage Ib carcinoma of the cervix. This difference was not explained by age but other factors possibly playing a role are considered. The combination of surgery and radiotherapy is discussed and only seems indicated for patients with stage Ib carcinoma and lymph node metastases.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1119875	<TITLE>Traumatic injuries to the duodenum: a report of 98 patients.</TITLE>Data of 98 patients who had sustained traumatic injuries to the duodenum during a recent 7-year period is reviewed. The overall mortality was 23.5%; that of the blunt injury group was 35%, that of the penetrating injury group was 20%. However, after the establishment of a trauma unit, the mortality for duodenal injuries fell from 32% to 12%. Death from duodenal wounds may be reduced by earlier hospitalization, earlier diagnosis and consequently earlier surgical repair. Vigorous treatment of shock is essential. A specialized trauma unit with personnel experienced in the management of shock and trauma problems provides a better environment to carry out the preoperative and postoperative care of the acutely injured patient. Adequate surgical treatment of the blunt injury and missile injury of the duodenum should consist of the following procedures: 1) repair of the duodenal wall utilizing conventional techniques; 2) internal decompression of the repair by afferent jejunostomy; 3) efferent jejunostomy for postoperative feeding; 4) temporary gastrostomy; and 5) external drainage of the repair. In certain selected instances, the simple stab wound of the duodenum may be treated by conventional repair without decompression, but a loop of jujunum should be sutured over the repair to prevent delayed disruption. The majority of patients with injuries to the duodenum have associated organs injured which also require considered surgical judgment and action.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1132081	<TITLE>Mechanism of vascular hyperresponsiveness in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.</TITLE>Hyperresponsiveness of resistance vessels has been described in various vascular beds of spontaneously hypertensive rats perfused with artificial medium. This change has been attributed to altered vascular dimensions secondary to the development of hypertension. To test the possibility that true changes in sensitivity might contribute independently to vasoconstrictor hyperresponsiveness in spontaneously hypertensive rats, threshold vasoconstrictor doses of norepinephrine and barium chloride were determined in denervated hindquarters of rats perfused at constant flow with autologous blood. Threshold constrictor responses to norepinephrine were elicited in the hypertensive rats at concentrations averaging less than one-third that required in controls. Threshold vasoconstrictor concentrations of barium were not significantly different between the two groups. The ratio of norepinephrine/barium sensitivity was also significantly elevated in the hypertensive group. These data suggest that in the presence of a full humoral complement, excitability (barium sensitivity) in resistance vessels of spontaneously hypertensive rats is not altered, whereas the smooth muscle is hypersensitive to norepinephrine. Thus, it appears that changes in sensitivity as well as altered vascular geometry are important in the production of vascular hyperresponsiveness in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.

1255271	<TITLE>Activity of L-cysteinesulfinate carboxy-lyase and persulfurase in livers of rats fed different levels of sulfate and cysteine.</TITLE>Activity of L-cysteinesulfinate carboxy-lyase (CSC) and persulfurase was measured in livers of rats fed 15% casein diets supplemented with (1) 0.53% cysteine, (2) 0.40% cysteine, (3) 0.40% cysteine + 0.10% sulfate, (4) 0.42% sulfate, or (5) 0.42% sulfate + 0.40% cysteine. The diets were fed to adult rats for 1 week and to weanling rats for periods of 1 and 4 weeks. At the end of each feeding period, the highest CSC activity was detected in livers from animals fed diet 4, but no differences in CSC activity were detected among livers from the other four groups. Persulfurase activity did not differ significantly among those weanling or adult rats fed the diets for 1 week but was lower among those fed diet 4 than diet 5 for 4 weeks. The acitivity patterns did not parallel those of taurine excretion or conjugation observed previously among rats fed the same diets, and may indicate that factors other than taurine synthesis and ingestion control those processes.

1338113	<TITLE>Calcium-activated force in a turkey model of spontaneous dilated cardiomyopathy: adaptive changes in thin myofilament Ca2+ regulation with resultant implications on contractile performance.</TITLE>Using saponin skinned fibers, we investigated whether decreased myofilament calcium responsiveness and contractile activation may in part contribute to heart failure in an animal model of idiopathic spontaneous cardiomyopathy (SCM). We addressed the question as to whether there are adaptive changes at the level of the thin myofilaments in turkey poults with SCM. The calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) required for 50% activation ([Ca2+]50%) was 0.80 +/- 0.12 microM (n = 12) vs. 0.76 +/- 0.08 microM (n = 12) and the Hill coefficient was 1.98 +/- 0.20 (n = 12) vs. 2.14 +/- 0.38 (n = 12) for control and SCM muscles respectively. Maximal Ca(2+)-activated force was not different between control fibers and fibers from failing hearts (3.83 +/- 0.88 g/mm2 vs. 3.65 +/- 0.39 g/mm2). These data indicate there are no differences in calcium-activation between fibers from control and failing myocardium. The effects of caffeine, an agent that increases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, were also studied. Addition of 10 mM caffeine resulted in a 0.06 pCa unit leftward shift of the force-pCa relationship in control hearts and 0.14 pCa units in SCM hearts. Caffeine (30 mM) increased force by 26 +/- 2.1% (n = 7) in control fibers and 44.5 +/- 8.7% (n = 8) in myopathic fibers at a pCa of 6.0. The increased responsiveness of muscles from failing hearts to caffeine indicates adaptive changes at the level of the thin myofilaments. Addition of dibutyryl-3',5'-cyclic-Adenosine Monophosphate (D-cAMP) resulted in a 0.21 pCa rightward shift on the calcium axis to higher intracellular calcium concentrations in control myocardium and 0.38 pCa units in SCM failing myocardium. The muscles were also sinusoidally oscillated at frequencies ranging between 0.01 and 100 Hz. In this analysis the frequency at which dynamic stiffness is minimum is taken as a measure of cross-bridge cycling rate. In control muscles, the frequency of minimum stiffness (fmin) was 1.20 +/- 0.11 (n = 4) whereas it was 0.71 +/- 0.08 Hz (n = 4) in myopathic muscles. The addition of 10 microM D-cAMP shifted fmin from 1.20 +/- 0.11 Hz to 1.68 +/- 0.09 Hz (delta = 0.48 +/- 0.06) in control fibers whereas in SCM fibers it caused greater shift of fmin from 0.71 +/- 0.08 Hz to 1.73 +/- 0.08 Hz (delta = 1.02 +/- 0.07). This differential effect of D-cAMP indicates adaptive changes at the level of the myofilaments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1450042	<TITLE>Response after withdrawal of tamoxifen and progestogens in advanced breast cancer.</TITLE>Tumor response after withdrawal of endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer with estrogens and androgens is well described. There have been few reports of withdrawal responses (WRs) after cessation of treatment with the newer antiestrogens and progestogens. We assessed WR in women after cessation of adjuvant therapy at first relapse, and after progression on first, second or third line endocrine therapy for advanced disease. One of seven patients (14%) responded after cessation of tamoxifen adjuvant therapy at relapse. Sixty-five of 72 patients were evaluable for WR after cessation of tamoxifen as first line therapy for advanced disease. There were five partial responses (8%) and 14 (22%) 'no change' with a median duration of WR of 10 months (range 3-40 months). WR were seen mainly in soft tissue disease but there were two responses in lung and two in bone. Four of 21 (19%) patients had a WR after cessation of norethisterone acetate (3) and tamoxifen (1), all used as second line therapy. WR are therefore demonstrable after cessation of tamoxifen and norethisterone acetate with durations of response similar to those found with additive therapy. Assessment of WR may represent a way of prolonging the overall response duration in patients with relatively indolent metastatic breast cancer, particularly in soft tissues.

1614310	<TITLE>Metabolic response of the human heart to inotropic stimulation: in vivo phosphorus-31 studies of normal and cardiomyopathic myocardium.</TITLE>In order to determine if an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption is accompanied by changes in high energy phosphates in normal subjects and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, phosphorus-31 spectra were acquired under resting conditions and during dobutamine infusion. In seven normal subjects, dobutamine raised the rate-pressure product to 226% of control. The ratio of PCr/ATP was 1.86 +/- 0.17 (mean +/- SE) under resting conditions and 1.90 +/- 0.22 (P = 0.44) with dobutamine infusion. In eight patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, dobutamine raised the rate-pressure product to 161% of control. As in the normal subjects, the ratio of PCr/ATP under resting conditions (1.63 +/- 0.24) was unchanged during dobutamine infusion (1.57 +/- 0.24, P = 0.38). These data indicate that increases in cardiac work do not have a major effect on high energy phosphate concentrations in normal subjects or in patients with clinically compensated dilated cardiomyopathy.

1654315	<TITLE>Rumen protected fat in kline barley or corn diets for beef cattle: digestibility, physiological, and feedlot responses.</TITLE>A rumen protected fat product composed of Ca salts of fatty acids (CAF) was evaluated in beef cattle diets. Dietary treatments in a metabolism trial (six steers, 251 +/- 15 kg) and Feedlot Trial 1 (15 individually fed heifers, 355 +/- 11 kg) consisted of 62.1% corn and 3.2% soybean meal (C), 32.6% corn and 33.1% Kline barley (CB), and 28.2% corn, 33.1% barley, and 4.5% CAF (CBF) on a DM basis. Apparent DM and OM digestibilities were higher (P less than .05) and NDF digestibility was lower (P less than .05) for C than for CB and CBF. Apparent ether extract digestibility was higher (P less than .01) for CBF than for CB. Retention of N was higher (P less than .05) for C than for CB and CBF. On d 42, Feedlot Trial 1 ruminal fluid acetate:propionate ratio was lower (P less than .01) for C than for CB and CBF, and the ratio was lower (P less than .01) for CB than for CBF. Treatments did not affect (P less than .10) ADG and DMI of heifers, but feed/gain was lower (P less than .05) for C than for CB and CBF, and feed/gain was higher (P less than .05) for CBF than for CB. In Feedlot Trial 2, steers and heifers were fed the C diet or a 57% corn, 21.4% peanut hull, 4.1% soybean meal, and 4.5% CAF diet (CF) on an ad libitum basis for 50 d. Ruminal fluid acetate and propionate were unaffected (P greater than .10) by dietary treatments. Cattle ADG tended to be lower (P greater than .10), DMI was lower (P less than .05), and feed/gain tended to be improved (P greater than .10) for CF compared with C. Kline barley has potential as a feed grain for cattle, but CAF may not improve beef cattle performance, especially when diets contain barley.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1711459	<TITLE>Differential regulation of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and -II) and IGF binding proteins during malnutrition in the neonatal rat.</TITLE>Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II are known to play a major role in fetal and early postnatal growth. The IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) are thought to be important in modulating the actions of the IGFs. In this paper, the effect of malnutrition in the neonatal rat on serum IGFs and IGFBPs and hepatic IGFBP messenger (m) RNA was examined. Control (C) dams (n = 9) were allowed ad libitum intake, whereas restricted (R) dams (n = 9) were limited to 50% of ad libitum intake throughout lactation, which results in decreased milk production and malnutrition of pups suckling on restricted dams. A subset of pups were cross-fostered from the R-dams to the C-dams from days 15-19 postpartum (PP) to investigate the effect of nutritional repletion (refed). Pups were killed on days 8, 12, 15, and 19 PP and liver and blood collected. Serum IGF-I and -II concentrations were measured by RIA after acid-chromatography to remove IGFBPs. Serum IGFBPs were characterized by Western ligand blot. Hepatic mRNA for IGFBP-1, -2, and -3 were determined by northern analysis. Body weight (BW) of R-pups was significantly less than C-pups by day 10 PP (P less than or equal to 0.05), and mean BW at day 19 was 56% of the C-pups. Refeeding from days 15-19 resulted in a significantly greater rate of growth vs. R-pups (3.2 vs. 0.9 g/day), and mean BW of refed pups at day 19 PP was 75% of C-pups. Malnutrition caused a significant reduction in both serum IGF-I and -II after day 12 PP, while causing an elevation in serum IGFBP-2. IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 mRNA expression were not significantly affected at days 8 and 12, but were elevated in livers of day 15 and 19 pups. Malnutrition caused a delay in the development shift from IGFBP-2 to IGFBP-3, which normally occurs between day 15 and 19 in the rat. Refeeding raised serum IGF-I and -II levels to those found in the C-pups and a trend toward normalization of IGFBP profiles. In conclusion, IGFs and IGFBPs are differentially regulated during neonatal malnutrition. The decrease in IGF peptide and induction of IGFBP-1 and -2 may provide protective mechanisms by inhibiting growth during malnutrition.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1712924	<TITLE>Subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage associated with necrotizing angiitis due to methamphetamine abuse--an autopsy case.</TITLE>The authors report an autopsy case of methamphetamine-related intracranial hemorrhage and vasculitis. A 22-year-old female was comatose after an intravenous injection of an unknown dose of methamphetamine. Computed tomographic scans demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in the corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from the right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via the vertebral artery. Postmortem studies found cerebral edema, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis, but no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Necrosis of vessel walls with destruction of the smooth muscle layer, but no leukocytotic infiltration of the vessel walls were observed in all major cerebral arteries. The hemorrhage probably resulted from medial necrosis in the large intracerebral vessels, and a sudden drug-induced rise in blood pressure.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1727113	<TITLE>Daily monitoring and correction of radiation field placement using a video-based portal imaging system: a pilot study.</TITLE>We have developed a video-based portal imaging system for radiotherapy localization. The system can acquire high quality portal images automatically using short (1-3 monitor unit) irradiations and immediately display the images. The major advantage of the imaging system is that it can be used routinely to check and correct patient positioning before much of the daily irradiation has been delivered. The portal imaging system has been used in a pilot study to monitor five patients during each of their daily treatments. The study has shown that: (i) image quality is sufficiently high to detect discrepancies in field placement from that prescribed on the simulator film; (ii) discrepancies in field placement occur frequently; and, (iii) routine correction of patient and block positioning can reduce the size of these discrepancies. This is the first time that field placement in radiation therapy has been checked and corrected routinely, before the treatment irradiation. However, limitations in the size of the field of view and in the methods of extracting and presenting the geometric information to the users limits the clinical utility of the imaging system. Solutions to these limitations are currently under development.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1805661	<TITLE>Effect of the infraorbital nerve transection on the sensory input subsystem in the masticatory system of newborn mice.</TITLE>To confirm a hypothetical idea that the masticatory system will play a fundamental function in the postnatal growth of the body, the centripetal mastication-related information flowing in the system was interrupted by cutting the infraorbital nerve on the newborn mice. The sham- and axotomy-operation mice were returned to their mother. 20 days after the operation the sensory input unit was studied in the serial frontal section histologically. On the other hand the body weight was measured every 5 days after the operation and the significant level was examined statistically. The results obtained are as follows: 1) The sensory input units (primary and secondary sensory neurons) have completely reduced to disappear in situ. 2) The significant differences between both groups were seen at the level of P less than 0.001 from the period of 20-day after the operation. In comparison with that of the sham-operation mice, the axotomy-operation mice have decreased about 20 to 30% in the body weight and so reduced in shape, characterized by the smaller head, a shorter trunk and limbs and a shorter, thinner tail. The experimental data suggest that the centripetal mastication-related information plays an important role in the postnatal growth of the masticatory system and the other functional systems of the body.

1812197	<TITLE>An analysis of success and failure of apicoectomies.</TITLE>The radiographs from 715 patient charts were analyzed to study the effect of 11 factors on the success and failure of apicoectomies. Of these, 424 had recall radiographs of 6 months or more and were evaluated for changes in radiolucencies. The data were analyzed by cross-tabulation and chi-square analysis for significant relationships. Complete healing was found in 65% of the recall cases, while incomplete and unsatisfactory healing occurred in 29.4% and 5.6% of the cases, respectively. Complete healing was found to increase with patient age. Those over 60 yr of age had the highest percentage of complete healing. No statistical difference in healing was found between maxillary and mandibular teeth. Also, postsurgical healing associated with those teeth which were inadequately obturated with gutta-percha, silver points, or paste-filling materials did not differ significantly. No significant difference in healing was found between the teeth that were retreated nonsurgically before surgery and those that were not. Healing was independent of the placement of a retrofilling as well as the type of retrofilling period. Significantly better healing was seen with teeth that were permanently restored following surgery.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1899279	<TITLE>Dual effect of osmotic cell swelling on prolactin secretion by acutely dispersed adenohypophyseal cells.</TITLE>Cell swelling induced by acute exposure to the permeant molecule urea or by medium hyposmolarity evoked a prompt PRL secretory burst from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. However, during continuous exposure greater than or equal to 10 min to these conditions inhibition of basal and TRH-induced PRL secretion occurred and there was an "off" burst of PRL secretion following return to basal conditions. Compared with continuous TRH stimulation which causes biphasic PRL secretion with a rapid high amplitude first phase secretory burst followed by a sustained low level second phase of secretion, cell swelling induced only "first phase" secretion. Removing Ca2+ from the medium or adding 50 microM verapamil markedly depressed the "off" secretory burst following return to basal conditions but had no effect on the initial high amplitude burst. Our data suggest that the effect of cell swelling on PRL secretion is complex and that there are at least two mechanisms for PRL secretion in normal anterior pituitary cells; these are differently affected by cell swelling and Ca2+ influx.

1902874	<TITLE>Regulation of plasminogen activator activity in arthritic joints.</TITLE>The plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin system has been implicated in the inflammation and connective tissue remodelling occurring in arthritic joints. PA activity is detected in cultures of human monocytes, synoviocytes and chondrocytes and can be regulated by a variety of cytokines found in diseased joints; PA inhibitors (PAI-1 and/or PAI-2) are also produced by these cells. We have shown that human monocytes can synthesize both urokinase-type PA (u-PA) and tissue-type PA (t-PA). One cytokine present in rheumatoid synovial fluids, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stimulates monocyte u-PA production; since this cytokine can also be produced by activated monocytes and other cell types in joints, than a "CSF network" can be produced leading to u-PA production. Another monocyte cytokine, interleukin 1, causes human synoviocytes to increase their u-PA expression, a response which can be dependent on the presence of endogenous cyclooxygenase products; this cytokine also causes human chondrocytes and cartilage tissue to produce increased u-PA and t-PA activity, i.e., under conditions during which cartilage is resorbed.

The results were seen as supporting Beck's early work which proposed a relationship between depression and self-defeating patterns. They also provide construct validity for the measure of Self-defeating Personality used in the study.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1970483	<TITLE>Intestinal microflora: metabolism of drugs and carcinogens.</TITLE>The intestinal microflora are capable of performing a wide variety of metabolic transformations. The digestive tract can be exposed to orally ingested, bile excreted, or blood-borne exogenous and endogenous substances that can be converted by the intestinal flora into carcinogens, mutagens, cocarcinogens or tumor promoting agents. In addition, the intestinal microflora can metabolize a wide variety of pharmacological agents resulting in production of metabolites required for the physiological activity of these agents or conversely in the inactivation of these agents. This article reviews the current knowledge of the relationship between the intestinal microflora and the metabolic reactions leading to the transformation of drugs and the production of mutagenic or carcinogenic compounds. The composition and distribution of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract is discussed and the type of reactions these bacteria perform is summarized. The conversion of specific substrates such as, rutin, digoxin, cycasin, azulfidine and cyclamate are discussed and the physiological implication of these conversions are presented.

1986031	<TITLE>Dose-dependent effects of scopolamine on nocturnal growth hormone secretion in normal adult men: relation to delta-sleep changes.</TITLE>To explore the sensitivity of nocturnal GH secretion to different degrees of cholinergic blockade, we investigated the effects of two doses of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (SCOP; 3.0 and 6.0 micrograms/kg, im) and placebo, administered in a randomized fashion at 2300 h on three nights to eight normal male volunteers. Both doses of SCOP produced significant reductions in mean nocturnal GH concentration compared to the effects of the placebo; the higher dose of SCOP reduced GH to a greater degree than the lower dose, but this difference was not statistically significant (mean, 2.3 micrograms/L after 6 micrograms/kg vs. 3.0 micrograms/L after 3 micrograms/kg). Both SCOP doses significantly shifted GH secretion into later portions of the night, with a significantly greater delay observed after the larger dose. Similarly, a significant delay in the time of the GH rise was produced by SCOP. In contrast, the effects of both doses of SCOP on delta-sleep or sleep onset were small. These data confirm earlier reports demonstrating that cholinergic muscarinic input represents a potentially important source of regulation of nocturnal GH release and suggest that the magnitude of the reduction in GH and the extent of delay in the GH rise time may reflect quantitative differences in the degree of cholinergic blockade. These data are in agreement with recent studies suggesting that the timing of GH release need not be associated with delta-sleep per se.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
1991127	<TITLE>Purification and characterization of a veratryl alcohol oxidase enzyme from the lignin degrading basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus.</TITLE>A veratryl alcohol oxidase (VAO) enzyme was discovered in cultures of Pleurotus ostreatus. The enzyme, which oxidizes veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde reducing O2 to H2O2, was purified to homogeneity and its main structural and catalytic properties have been determined. The enzyme is a glycoprotein and contains FAD as a prosthetic group. The amino acid composition and carboxy- and amino-terminal sequences were determined. Primary aromatic alcohols with methoxy substituents in position four are good substrates for VAO; cinnamyl alcohol is the substrate which is oxidized faster whereas coniferyl alcohol is oxidized at a slower rate. The enzyme is moderately thermostable (t1/2(55 degrees C) about 1.5 h, apparent melting temperature about 60 degrees C). The enzyme stability in 50% water/organic solvents mixtures has also been studied.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
2027812	<TITLE>Peripheral white blood cell counts and bacterial meningitis: implications regarding diagnostic efficacy in febrile children.</TITLE>In order to investigate the clinical value of peripheral white blood cell variables for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis among young, febrile children, we compared total peripheral white counts, total segmented neutrophil counts, total band counts, and the ratio of immature-to-total neutrophils (I:T ratio) among 46 children with bacterial meningitis, 130 children with aseptic meningitis, and 56 febrile children with culture confirmed extrameningeal bacterial infection. Children with bacterial meningitis were comparable to those with aseptic meningitis with respect to median total white blood cell counts and median total segmented neutrophil counts but had a significantly higher median total band count (1760/microliters vs 378/microliters, P = 0.0001) and a significantly higher median I:T ratio (0.40 vs 0.09, P less than 0.001). In contrast, children with bacterial meningitis were comparable to those with an extrameningeal bacterial infection with respect to median total band count but had a significantly lower median total peripheral white count (10,650/microliters vs 15,300/microliters, P = 0.0013), a lower median total segmented neutrophil count (4511/microliters vs 6796/microliters, P = 0.023), and a significantly higher median I:T ratio (0.40 vs 0.15, P less than 0.001). Children with meningitis who were bacteremic at presentation had a significantly lower total white cell count (P = 0.001) and significantly higher I:T ratio (P = 0.005) when compared with children who had an extrameningeal infection and concurrent bacteremia at presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
2071088	<TITLE>Spindle cell haemangioendothelioma: a clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study indicative of a non-neoplastic lesion.</TITLE>Spindle cell haemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular lesion, of which 35 cases have been previously reported. A further 20 cases are reported herein. These lesions affected a wide age range in both sexes, and showed a predilection for the extremities. Twelve patients had multiple lesions and, in these cases, local progression over many years but no true recurrence was typical. None of the 20 patients developed metastases, but one later developed an angiosarcoma. Individual cases were associated with congenital lymphoedema. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and early-onset varicose veins. Histologically, in addition to the admixture of cavernous spaces and solid spindle cell/epithelioid cell areas, the presence both of irregularly distributed and perivascular smooth muscle cells and of malformed variably-sized vessels at the periphery of almost every lesion was noted in each case. Reticulin staining, immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscopy revealed the presence of primitive vessel formation and partial endothelial differentiation in the solid spindle cell areas. Combining these data with those from previously published series, it is suggested that spindle cell haemangioendothelioma is a non-neoplastic lesion (rather than a borderline malignancy as it is currently regarded) and that its development correlates with histological and/or clinical evidence of a malformed vasculature at the affected site.

2180249	<TITLE>Endotoxin-induced otitis media with effusion in the mouse. Immunohistochemical analysis.</TITLE>A model of endotoxin-induced otitis media with effusion was developed in healthy BALB/c mice. Endotoxin extracted from Salmonella typhimurium (10 micrograms/ml) was injected into the middle ear bulla transtympanically and the resultant inflammatory response was analyzed using immunohistochemical methods. Serous effusions were observed otoscopically and mucosal edema and infiltrate were studied histologically, both peaking at 3 days and essentially resolving by 7 days. However, persistence of a small area of inflammation in the round window niche was consistently present at 2 weeks. The specific cellular responses to endotoxin were analysed by histologic and immunohistologic examination of the murine temporal bone. We used antibodies to identify T-lymphocytes (anti-Lyt-1, -Lyt-2), macrophages and neutrophils (anti-Mac-1), and immunoglobulins (anti-IgA, -IgG, -IgM). In the mucosal/submucosal infiltrate Mac-1+ and Lyt-1+ cells peaked from days 1 to 3. Within the luminal effusion Mac-1+ and Lyt-1+ cells as well as diffuse (not cell-associated) IgG, IgM, and IgA staining were most prevalent from days 1 to 3, while IgG-bearing plasma cells formed the majority of the luminal cells observed at 1 to 2 weeks. No significant influx of T-suppressor cells was observed at any time. The round window niche and anterior portion of the tympanic bulla mucosa were found to be the most reactive areas. These results suggest that endotoxin alone is capable of producing an inflammatory infiltrate in the mouse consistent with otitis media with effusion, and that the interaction of endotoxin with resident immunocytes of the middle ear, as well as serum derived immune cells, is consistent with the known phlogistic properties of endotoxin.

2185035	<TITLE>Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase does not affect the Pro-43 cis-trans isomerization rate in folded calbindin D9k.</TITLE>The calcium-binding protein calbindin D9k has previously been shown to exist in two folded forms only differing in the proline cis-trans isomerism of the Gly-42-Pro-43 amide bond. This bond is located in a flexible loop connecting the two EF-hand Ca2+ sites. Calbindin D9k therefore constitutes a unique test case for investigating if the recently discovered enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) can affect the cis-trans exchange rate in a folded protein. The 1H NMR saturation transfer technique has been used to measure the rate of interconversion between the cis and trans forms of calbindin in the presence of PPIase (PPIase:calbindin concentration ratio 1:10) at 35 degrees C. No rate enhancement could be detected.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
2214783	<TITLE>Testing for fluoxymesterone (Halotestin) administration to man: identification of urinary metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</TITLE>Fluoxymesterone, an anabolic steroid, is metabolized in man primarily by 6 beta-hydroxylation, 4-ene-reduction, 3-keto-reduction, and 11-hydroxy-oxidation. These pathways of metabolism are suggested by the positive identification of 4 metabolites and the tentative identification of 3 other metabolites. Detection of the drug in urine is possible for at least 5 days after a single 10 mg oral dose to previously untreated adult males, by monitoring the presence of 2 metabolites, since the parent drug is not detectable more than 1 day after the dose.

A number of laws and regulations have improved the system, which is discussed in detail. The discussion includes an overview of health policy, service delivery, and the financing of care. Is the current French system of Maternal and Child Health responsible for the good health of today's children? This question is addressed through selected examples. Finally, failures and short-comings of the system are described, including the persistence of underserved groups, unequal access to care, and other problems.

2366640	<TITLE>Effects of osmotic manipulation of intracellular hydration of HeLa S-3 cells on their proton NMR relaxation times.</TITLE>Pellets of HeLa from suspension cultured cells in isotonic medium (300 mosmolar) were introduced into a Bruker CXP100 NMR spectrophotometer at 80 mHz within 5 min of the start of centrifugation. T1 and T2 times were measured within a total elapsed time of 20-25 min at 80 mHz and 37 degrees C, and averaged 1430 msec and 120 msec, respectively. Extrapolation to zero extracellular space gave a corrected T1 of 1370 msec. For cells collected after 10 min in hypotonic medium (down to 30 mosmolar) increased proton density correlated well with increased cell water content, but relaxation times did not rise in proportion to that predicted for the entry of "bulk" water (T1 of 4700 msec), except when swelling approached lysis point. Cells partially dehydrated by 10 min in hypertonic medium of up to 1500 mosmolar have also been analyzed, but once again the shortening of T1 was not proportional to the loss of "free" (bulk phase) water. At the upper limit of hypertonic treatment, lacunae or vacuoles of a watery nature separated within the cytomatrix, preventing maximum dehydration. The relationship of cell water to T1 is complex over the whole range of tonicity that HeLa S-3 cells tolerate. The data indicate, however, that hypotonically induced water probably has an average T1 time considerably lower than bulk phase water. In contrast, raising the total extracellular volume with medium had precisely the predicted effect on T1 time, further strengthening the case that water taken up by cell acquires a shorter T1 time. Cells adapting to hypotonic conditions oscillated in size and water content over 2-3 hr before returning to near their initial volume. Under these circumstances, T1 oscillated in the same way but with a reduced amplitude, consistent with the above findings.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
2395327	<TITLE>Transforming growth factor-beta stimulates wound healing and modulates extracellular matrix gene expression in pig skin. I. Excisional wound model.</TITLE>The effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on matrix gene expression has been investigated during the process of wound repair, where the formation of new connective tissue represents a critical step in restoring tissue integrity. Split-thickness excisional wounds in the pig were studied by in situ hybridization in order to obtain subjective findings on the activity and location of cells involved in matrix gene expression after the administration of recombinant TGF-beta 1. Data focus on the stimulatory role of this growth factor in granulation tissue formation, on the enhanced mRNA content of collagen types I and III, fibronectin, TGF-beta 1 itself, and on the reduction in stromelysin mRNA, suggesting that increased matrix formation measured after treatment with TGF-beta 1 is due to fibroplasia regulated by the abundance of mRNAs for several different structural, matrix proteins as well as inhibition of proteolytic phenomena elicited by metalloproteinases. These studies reveal elastin mRNA early in the repair process, and elastin mRNA expression is enhanced by administration of TGF-beta 1. Moreover, we show that TGF-beta 1 was auto-stimulating in wounds, accounting, at least in part, for the persistent effects of single doses of this multipotential cytokine.	Activation of TGF-beta 1 ameliorated a wound healing disease model
2550984	<TITLE>Cloning and genetic analysis of tra cistrons of the Tra 2/Tra 3 region of plasmid RP1.</TITLE>Transfer-defective mutants of the 10.4-kb Tra 2/Tra 3 region of RP1 were identified by their ability to be complemented by clones carrying all or part of this region. The respective mutations occurred in six cistrons whose order (traA, B, E, R, P, Q) and location were determined by deletion and insertion mapping. The cistrons occupy a minimum of 5.5 kb with the most distal, traA, spanning the 28.0-kb map position and traR the KpnI site at map position 24.1 kb. Each cistron is expressed independently, as Tn5 or Tn504 insertions in any one cistron do not affect the other five. The phenotypes controlled by each cistron suggest that all contribute to pilus biosynthesis/function while three (traB, R, and P) also contribute to surface exclusion. Given the occurrence of tra cistrons in the "silent" region between Tra 2 and Tra 3 we propose that the epithet "Tra 2" should be used to describe this entire region.

Wantland's egg medium was unsuitable for growth of E. gingivalis. Accompanying bacteria became resistant to penicillin and streptomycin, overwhelming the amoeba culture. MSF medium was also unsuitable for the cultivation of E. gingivalis. Bacterial growth was heavy and protozoan growth sparse. MSF medium without mercaptosuccinic acid, but with rice starch, dextran or levan substituted for glucose and with Yersinia enterocolitica added, supported limited growth of the amoeba. Unmodified TTY-SB medium did not sustain growth of E. gingivalis. However, when rice starch suspension was substituted for glucose, L-cysteine HCl was deleted, and a Crithidia sp. was added to the E. gingivalis culture grown xenically, enhanced growth of the oral amoeba resulted in this modified TTY-SB medium. E. gingivalis is very sensitive to changes in incubation temperature. Optimum growth was found to be in the narrow range from 34.5 to 35 degrees C for all media tested.

2641460	<TITLE>Preparation of a fine powder of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose suitable for inhalation to diagnose lung diseases by means of PET.</TITLE>Fine 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) powder was obtained by adding diethyl ether into a methyl alcohol solution of 18FDG and other sugar as seed. When micronized particles of sodium N-acetyl-neuraminate (Neu5Ac-Na) were used as seed crystals, particles containing 18FDG were obtained and 80% of them were smaller than 10 microns in size. More than 60% of these crystals were 4-6 microns in size. In a preclinical study of forced inhalation in a dog, the 18FDG fine powder was mainly distributed in the trachea. The radioactivity in the trachea then increased once and a gradual decrease followed. The radioactivity was transferred into the blood and radioactivity incorporation into the heart was observed. After a normal volunteer inhaled 18FDG dry powder aerosol, the radioactivity was found in the respiratory tract and the peripheral area of the lung by means of PET. Absorption and in vivo dynamics of the 18FDG were also analysed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Cell viability of disaggregated Ca1- and CA3-neurons was compared. These isolated neurons are well suited for whole-cell patch-clamp measurements as well as for pharmacological investigations.

2689357	<TITLE>Biological activities caused by far-infrared radiation.</TITLE>Contrary to previous presumption, accumulated evidence indicates that far-infrared rays are biologically active. A small ceramic disk that emits far-infrared rays (4-16 microns) has commonly been applied to a local spot or a whole part of the body for exposure. Pioneering attempts to experimentally analyze an effect of acute and chronic radiation of far-infrared rays on living organisms have detected a growth-promoting effect in growing rats, a sleep-modulatory effect in freely behaving rats and an insomiac patient, and a blood circulation-enhancing effect in human skin. Questionnaires to 542 users of far-infrared radiator disks embedded in bedclothes revealed that the majority of the users subjectively evaluated an improvement of their health. These effects on living organisms appear to be non-specifically triggered by an exposure to far-infrared rays, which eventually induce an increase in temperature of the body tissues or, more basically, an elevated motility of body fluids due to decrease in size of water clusters.

2704030	<TITLE>Quinazoline antifolates inhibiting thymidylate synthase: 2-desamino derivatives with enhanced solubility and potency.</TITLE>The poor solubility of the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibiting antifolate 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid has posed problems for its clinical use and is probably responsible for its renal toxicity. The insolubility is caused by the 2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxopyrimidine moiety of the drug which stabilizes the solid state by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In examining this moiety we have removed the 2-amino group and now report on 2-desamino-10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (8e) and four analogues with H, Me, Et, and allyl at N10. 3,4-Dihydro-4-oxo-6-methylquinazoline was solubilized by alkylating the lactam nitrogen with chloromethyl pivalate. Reaction with N-bromosuccinimide gave the corresponding 6-bromomethyl compound, which was coupled with diethyl N-(4-aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate or the appropriate N-substituted derivative thereof. The quinazoline N3 nitrogen and carboxyl groups in the product were simultaneously deprotected by cold alkali in the final step to give the desired five antifolates. These were tested against L1210 TS and it was found that removal of the 2-amino group caused a slight (3-9-fold) loss of TS inhibition. 8e was only 8-fold a lesser TS inhibitor than the parent drug. Inhibition of rat liver dihydrofolate reductase was reduced by over 1 order of magnitude for three compounds tested. All five analogues were more cytotoxic to L1210 cells in culture than their 2-amino counterparts; 8e was 8.5-fold more active with an ID50 of 0.4 microM. This remarkable result probably owes to increased cellular penetration. 8e was 5-fold more soluble than 1 at pH 5.0 and greater than 340-fold more soluble at pH 7.4.

Biocarbazin administration in doses 50 and 200 mg/kg of body weight to adult male BALB/c mice suppresses the process of spermatogenesis. Seminiferous tubule of the testis displayed dose-dependent histological alterations manifested with decrease of mitotically dividing cells and increase in the number of multinucleated spermatocytes and spermatids.

2827076	<TITLE>Decline of blocking effect of cobalt ions on transmission from photoreceptors to horizontal cells during its prolonged application.</TITLE>In high-Mg2+ medium, luminosity-type cone horizontal cells (L-cells) hyperpolarized and lost their photoresponses at a full membrane hyperpolarization of about -80 mV. These effects of high-Mg2+ are attributed to the blockade of transmitter release from photoreceptors. Application of Co2+ hyperpolarized the L-cells at first and the photoresponses disappeared at full membrane hyperpolarization. After a little while, however, the membrane potential began to depolarize and the light stimuli again evoked responses. The recovery of the membrane potential and photoresponses indicates that prolonged application of Co2+ weakens its ability to block transmission from photoreceptors to L-cells.

Thirteen patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), 3 patients in remission states of ATL and 5 patients with non-ATL were examined. All ATL cells expressed the HT462 antigen, however cells from patients in remission did not express the HT462 antigen. A low percentage of cells from 2 out of 5 patients with non-ATL mature leukemic T cells expressed the HT462 antigen, although these cells did not express other HTLV-I related antigens. Cells of HTLV-I infected human cell lines expressed the HT462 antigen. Three HTLV-I infected rat cell lines (TARS-1, TART-1, TARL-2) did not express the HT462 antigen, although cells of these lines expressed other HTLV-I related antigens. Characterization of the HT462 antigen by strip radioimmunoassay based on western blotting technique using cell lysates of HUT102 cells revealed two additional bands (p68, p35) together with previously reported proteins (gp52, p42). Only p68 was seen in western blots using cell lysates of the rat cell lines. These findings further suggest that the HT462 antigen is a cellular component induced in virus transformed human cells and not a virus encoded protein.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

2911526	<TITLE>Septic shock: special needs of patients with cancer.</TITLE>Septic shock results in activated coagulation, cell injury, metabolic changes, and altered blood flow through the microcirculation. If left untreated, the end result is multiple organ failure and death. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of developing shock because of both host-related and treatment-related risk factors. Nursing cognizance of high-risk patients should promote close observation for signs and symptoms of early septic shock. Septic shock may be managed on the unit but signs of impending circulatory collapse and respiratory failure may warrant transferring the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU). Nursing measures include assessment, patient teaching, monitoring of all body systems, and special attention to the patient's psychosocial needs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
2938201	<TITLE>Induction of ventrolateral hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation in diabetic rats.</TITLE>Diabetic rats were used to test a previous hypothesis that alterations in ventrolateral hypothalamic (VLH) fatty acid oxidation observed in over- and underfed rats were a function of the animals' peripheral energy balance and not merely a function of their energy intake. Standard adaptations to the diabetic condition were exhibited in streptozotocin diabetic rats such as depressed body weights, hyperphagia and hyperglycemia, elevated serum free fatty acids, depressed insulin concentrations, depressed hepatic glucose oxidation and elevated hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Rates of VLH fatty acid oxidation to CO2 and to an acid, water-soluble fraction in diabetic rats were elevated relative to non-diabetic rats. The alterations in VLH fatty acid oxidation in diabetic rats were similar to changes previously observed in animals exhibiting a negative energy balance. The results were discussed with respect to the concept that VLH fatty acid oxidation was a component in the recognition of peripheral energy balance and, in part, served to alter the regulators of energy balance and food intake.

2956181	<TITLE>Oral tolerance in protein-deprived mice. II. Evidence of normal 'gut processing' of ovalbumin, but suppressor cell deficiency, in deprived mice.</TITLE>The induction of oral tolerance for DTH responses to ovalbumin is impaired in protein-deprived mice. This may be via the effects of protein malnutrition on short-lived Ts cells, but an alternative explanation is that the gut handling of antigen is abnormal. We have attempted to transfer tolerance from protein-deprived and control mice to naive recipients by using spleen cells, collected 7 days after an OVA feed at a time when Ts cells should be present, or by using serum, collected 1 hr after feeding, which should contain tolerogenic, 'gut-processed' antigen. Suppression of DTH was transferred with 7-day spleen cells and with 1-hr serum from normal, protein-sufficient mice. Mice that received spleen cells from protein-deprived donors were not tolerant, but suppression was readily transferred with serum from deprived mice, indicating that their capacity for intestinal antigen processing was normal. Furthermore, the quantity of absorbed antigen in the serum 1 hr after feeding was similar in both protein-deprived and normal groups. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that short-term protein deprivation depletes a population of short-lived Ts cells which control DTH oral tolerance.

3007194	<TITLE>The relationship between GABA immunoreactivity and labelling by local uptake of [3H]GABA in the striate cortex of monkey.</TITLE>An antiserum to GABA was used in the macaque monkey to determine whether neurons that accumulate exogenously applied [3H]GABA in vivo are also immunoreactive for GABA. Following the injection of [3H]GABA into different laminae of striate cortex in two untreated animals and in one animal treated with amino-oxyacetic acid, selective accumulation of the labelled amino acid was demonstrated in perikarya by autoradiography. Radiographically labelled neurons (n, 519) and their unlabelled neighbours were tested in consecutive 0.5 micron thick sections by immunocytochemistry for GABA immunoreactivity. Injection of [3H]GABA did not increase the number of neurons showing GABA immunoreactivity. On the contrary many of the cells that accumulated [3H]GABA were immunonegative. These neurons were mostly located in layers IVC and VA following [3H]GABA injection into layers II-III, and in layers upper III and II following injection into layers V and VI. A comparison of the position of these neurons with known local projection patterns in the striate cortex of monkey suggests that GABA-immunonegative neurons may nevertheless become labelled by [3H]GABA if most of their local axon terminals fall within the injection site. The interlaminar projection of GABA-immunopositive neurons, which probably contain endogenous GABA, could be deduced from the position of the [3H]GABA injection site that leads to their autoradiographic labelling. Although the present study confirmed our previous results on the interlaminar connections of neurons that accumulate [3H]GABA, it demonstrated that [3H]GABA labelling alone may not be a sufficient criterion to assess the GABAergic nature of neurons in the striate cortex of monkey.

3260009	<TITLE>Importance of early initiation of dietary protein restriction for the prevention of experimental progressive renal disease.</TITLE>The effect of dietary protein restriction on the progress of renal dysfunction was investigated in rats with adriamycin (ADR)-induced progressive glomerular disease. Dietary protein was reduced from 20% (normal diet) to 5% (low protein) immediately after (ADR-0w), 8 weeks (ADR-8w) or 16 weeks (ADR-16w) after the repeated injection of ADR. In the unrestricted (ADR-UR) group rats were fed 20% of protein throughout the 24-week experiment. Massive urinary protein developed immediately after ADR injection and significantly decreased by reducing dietary protein in all the groups (ADR-0w, ADR-8w, ADR-16w). However, plasma protein and serum albumin were low irrespective of the improvement of urinary protein. BUN and serum creatinine were unchanged in ADR-0w and ADR-8w groups, while they were increased in ADR-16w and ADR-UR groups. Glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy were much less severe in ADR-0w and ADR-8w than in ADR-16w and ADR-UR groups. The results indicate that dietary protein restriction checks the further progress of renal dysfunction. The importance of the time when protein intake should be reduced is discussed.

3308524	<TITLE>Biological mechanisms of ageing.</TITLE>In a short review of the theories or proposed biological mechanisms of ageing it is necessary to be very selective in the ideas which are included or rejected. Although many theories of ageing are advanced in the literature a high proportion can be considered to be special cases of a previous hypothesis. No one individual theory satisfactorily explains the biological mechanism of ageing, indeed elements of many theories may be required to understand such a complex phenomena. Such a view has been formally expressed by Wright and Davison who consider that all theories represent too simplistic an approach to the understanding of ageing, a biochemical complexity which can only be resolved using system analysis techniques.

3310745	<TITLE>Changes in systemic and pulmonary vascular reactivity in hypertension following nifedipine and verapamil.</TITLE>Excessive vascular tone and overresponsiveness to adrenergic stimuli characterize the hemodynamics of the greater and the lesser circulation in hypertension. We tested whether calcium entry blockade with verapamil (11 cases) or nifedipine (11 cases) may improve the vascular regulation in high blood pressure. Mental arithmetic and cold were used as adrenergic activators. The former stimulus produced obvious elevation of epinephrine plasma concentration, increase of cardiac output (CO), slight systemic vasodilatation, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and rise of blood pressure in both circuits. After calcium antagonists, the epinephrine reaction to the arithmetic test was significantly attenuated, variations in CO and systemic blood pressure were unchanged, pulmonary vasoconstriction was abolished, and the pressure rise in the lesser circuit was halved. The cold pressor test increased norepinephrine plasma concentration (NE pc), systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, and vascular resistance and did not alter CO. The attained NE pc during cold was unvaried after verapamil and significantly enhanced after nifedipine; pressure and resistance responses of the two circuits were almost unchanged after the former, whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance rises were importantly attenuated after the latter compound, resulting in much lower pressure reactivity. A modulation of the sympathoadrenal reaction, per se, can explain changes in the systemic and in the pulmonary vasomotion with calcium blockade during arithmetic. It would seem that after verapamil the sympathetic system was still activated during cold to such an extent as to maintain the same vasoconstrictor potency. NE pc suggests that the sympathetic discharge was not reduced by nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Like the previously described 5-hydroxymethyluracil DNA glycosylase, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine DNA glycosylase was not detectable in bacterial extracts. The phylogenetic distribution of these activities indicates that their primary function is the maintenance of methylcytosine residues in differentiated tissue.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3392252	<TITLE>The use of [185W] thiotungstates for tracer studies in secondary hypocuprosis in cattle.</TITLE>[185W] thiotungstates were synthesized in-vitro and purified by techniques developed for thiomolybdates. [185W] trithiotungstate (15 mg W) injected intravenously into cattle was mainly associated with albumin albumin. The presence of the compound in plasma when injected in larger amounts (0.2 to 1 gW) caused an increase in albumin-bound copper and transiently depressed ceruloplasmin diamine oxidase activity. It is suggested that the long-lived, less costly 185W could prove a convenient alternative to 99Mo for tracer studies with labelled thio-compounds in animals.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3406695	<TITLE>Aortic origin of the right pulmonary artery: a cause of heart failure in infancy at high altitude.</TITLE>The development of technique for surgical correction of aortic origin of the right pulmonary artery is described. In the first patient, aged 7 years, the operation was performed via bilateral thoracotomy, with standby for extracorporeal circulation, and the right pulmonary artery was anastomosed directly to the left, using side clamps on both aorta and left pulmonary artery. The currently preferred procedure is to operate as early as possible in infancy, using perfusion at 30 degrees C with ventricular fibrillation and without cross-clamping of the aorta. Wide mobilization of the pulmonary artery probably prevents stenosis at the end-to-side anastomosis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3430303	<TITLE>Rectovestibular fistula associated with colonic atresia.</TITLE>A complete staged reconstruction has been performed on a 4-year-old girl with imperforate anus, rectovestibular fistula, and colonic atresia. The rectal remnant was a small 10 cm long segment, widely separated from the right colon. An end colostomy had been performed in the neonatal period elsewhere. Associated urinary anomalies were treated first. At the age of 4 years, distal colon remnant dilatations were started using a balloon catheter through the vestibular orifice. Four months later, end-to-end ascending colon-sigmoid anastomosis was done, after colonic mobilization and tapering. A temporary loop ileostomy was left at the left upper quadrant. Three months later a posterior sagittal anorectoplasty was successfully performed. At the age of 5 years she has achieved fecal continence, after the ileostomy closure.

3549508	<TITLE>Evidence that host size determines liver size: studies in dogs receiving orthotopic liver transplants.</TITLE>Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in two groups of dogs; Group I animals consisted of large dogs that served as recipients of livers obtained from smaller dogs while Group II animals consisted of dogs that received liver from donor dogs of nearly the same size. The small-for-size livers transplanted into the Group I dogs rapidly increased in size over the course of 2 weeks until they achieved a size equal to that originally present in the larger recipient dogs. In contrast, the livers transplanted into dogs of the same size as the donors underwent some degree of atrophy. In both groups of animals, plasma levels of insulin and glucagon and hepatic (graft) activities of thymidine kinase and ornithine decarboxylase were followed serially. The only difference between the two groups of animals for these measures was that the ornithine decarboxylase activity rose to a greater degree in the liver that underwent graft enlargement. These data suggest that recipient size determines, at least in part, liver graft size once it is transplanted. These data also suggest that of the parameters followed, only ornithine decarboxylase activity parallels the finding of growth of the transplanted liver.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3800158	<TITLE>Unified approach for nonmalignant esophageal lesions using right colon and terminal ileum. A 30-year experience.</TITLE>Over the past 30 years, the authors reconstructed the esophagus with the right colon in 85 patients who had congenital and benign disease. The first individual operated upon in 1955 was asymptomatic. Nine patients had congenital tracheoesophageal fistula with atresia, four esophageal varices, 31 advanced obliterative esophagitis, and 23 corrosive destruction. In seven patients, severe esophagitis followed esophagogastrectomy, four had unsuccessful operations for achalasia, and seven had colon bypass following esophageal perforation. Eleven early nonfatal complications occurred. Remote nonfatal complications were seen in six patients. Three early deaths followed dehiscence of an intrathoracic esophago-colon anastomosis, and one patient died from peritonitis (4%). Four individuals died over the study period, and five patients were lost to follow-up. The late results in 72 patients show that 61 (84%) believe they have a satisfactory result, nine (13%) individuals are symptomatic, and two patients (4%) are classified as failures. Early complications have been minimized by employing preoperative intestinal angiograms and anastomotic stapling techniques, and by using the Doppler intraoperatively to prognosticate colon blood flow. Significant observations have been: Anastomosis in the neck is preferable; the transplanted colon dilates from loss of motor activity but is functionally adequate; an isoperistaltic segment is preferable, but antiperistaltic segments can be used; and colonic mucosa is relatively resistant to acid-peptic digestion.

3894888	<TITLE>Decrease in respiration activity related to prodigiosin synthesis in Serratia marcescens.</TITLE>Variation in the cell respiration rate of pigmented and nonpigmented strains of Serratia marcescens was exhibited. The respiration rate of a pigmented strain decreased earlier than that of nonpigmented strains in the late exponential or early stationary phase. However when prodigiosin synthesis was not induced by exchange of carbon sources in the medium, the decrease in the respiration rate of the pigmented strain was the same as that of nonpigmented strains. Measurement of the oxygen consumption rate in the sonicated cell membrane by adding NADH solution showed that the rate in the pigmented strain was lower than that in nonpigmented strains. Furthermore, the cell membrane of prodigiosin-induced organisms was more sensitive to respiration inhibitors than that of pigment-noninduced organisms of the pigmented strain. These results showed that the respiration activity was decreased by prodigiosin synthesis in S. marcescens.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3902470	<TITLE>Recombinant murine GM-CSF from E. coli has biological activity and is neutralized by a specific antiserum.</TITLE>We report the production and characterization of a mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) made in Escherichia coli. The synthesis of mGM-CSF was directed by a plasmid containing a gene isolated from the EL-4 cell line. After induction of expression and accumulation of the protein in E. coli, mGM-CSF accounted for 10% of total cellular protein. This recombinant mGM-CSF was purified to 90% homogeneity by chaotrope extraction and gel filtration. Recombinant mGM-CSF, like the native molecule, stimulates the growth of granulocyte and macrophage colonies in serum-free cultures of mouse bone marrow cells. Antibodies raised against recombinant mGM-CSF not only reacted with the recombinant protein but also neutralized the biological activity of both native and recombinant mGM-CSF. These results indicate that the functional structure of the recombinant protein is similar to that of native mGM-CSF.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3941273	<TITLE>Subcellular characterization of the endocytosis of small oligomers of mouse immunoglobulin G in murine macrophages.</TITLE>To characterize the internalization and degradation of model immune complexes in murine macrophages, the endocytosis of well-defined radiolabeled IgG dimers and heavy oligomers (5 to 7 IgG molecules per complex), which were covalently cross-linked at the antigen-combining site, was studied. Of those heavy oligomers which were bound to the cell at 4 degrees C, 50 to 60% (400,000 molecules of IgG) were internalized within 30 min at 37 degrees C and, subsequently, were completely degraded over a period of 3 hr. Low pH had little effect on the dissociation of the oligomer from its receptor. The degradation of oligomers was markedly inhibited when macrophages were treated with monensin, a proton ionophore which raises organelle pH. Because this treatment did not prevent the delivery of oligomer into the lysosome, the transport of a soluble complex of IgG from the cell surface to the lysosome was not a pH-dependent event. On the other hand, 25 to 30% (50,000 molecules) of those dimers capable of binding to the cell entered the macrophage, but only 5000 molecules were degraded. When macrophages were studied by using density gradient centrifugation, within 15 min, heavy oligomers were found in a vesicle which sedimented at a density between that of the plasma membrane and lysosome. The density of this vesicle was similar to that of endosomes studied in other receptor-ligand systems. Heavy oligomers were within lysosomes shortly thereafter. Incubation of cells at 18 degrees C prevented the appearance of heavy oligomer within the lysosomes and resulted in the concentration of oligomers within an intracellular compartment of a density slightly heavier than that of plasma membrane. At 37 degrees C, dimers sedimented in a similar region of the gradient. But unlike heavy oligomers, dimers never entered lysosomes. These data suggest that the degree of Fc receptor clustering induced by oligomers of IgG influenced the intracellular fate of the ligand.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
3960424	<TITLE>Incidence and recurrence rate of abruptio placentae in Sweden.</TITLE>It is desirable to identify those pregnancies that run an increased risk of abruptio placentae, as this disorder still is associated with a high perinatal mortality. Data were collected from the Swedish nationwide birth registry system on all 894,619 births in Sweden in the period 1973 to 1981. The overall incidence of abruptio placentae was 0.44%, with a perinatal mortality of 20.2% and a cesarean section frequency of 74.6%. The incidence of abruptio placentae was significantly increased in the case of twin birth, male offspring, mothers below 20 years of age, and with every delivery after the second one. A history of abruptio placentae increased the risk of a similar incident in a subsequent pregnancy by 10.2-fold. The frequency of cesarean section in subsequent parturitions remained high (32.1%) even in the absence of reabruptio placentae, thus demonstrating the need to identify further risk groups.

5466048	<TITLE>Studies of laryngotracheitis virus in avian tissue cultures. 3. Enhancement of infectivity by diethylaminoethyl-dextran.</TITLE>Diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) enhanced the infectivity of laryngotracheitis virus (LTV) for chicken kidney (CK) cells when cultures were treated before inoculation with virus and when DEAE-D was present in the inoculum. Infectivity was not increased when cultures were treated after virus had adsorbed to cells; since infection was not synchronized, most of the virus had probably already penetrated the plasma membrane by the time DEAE-D was added. Maximal enhancement occurred when DEAE-D was present in the inoculum. Enhancement of a lesser degree occurred when virus and DEAE-D were mixed, diluted, and inoculated onto cultures. Adsorption of LTV at 37 C as compared to that at 5 C usually yields about a threefold greater number of plaques after a 2-hr adsorption period. However, when DEAE-D was incorporated in the inoculum, greater enhancement occurred at 5 C than at 37 C, and the number of plaques produced at both adsorption temperatures was about equal. Results are compatible with the hypothesis that increased adsorption is a factor in enhancement of infectivity of LTV by DEAE-D.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

6201500	<TITLE>Analysis of serotonin and derivatives by reversed-phase ion-pair partition chromatography with fluorometric and electrochemical detection.</TITLE>A flexible and efficient system is described for reversed-phase ion-pair partition-chromatographic analysis of serotonin, its precursors tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan, its main metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and tryptamine. The chromatographic system consists of tri-n-butylphosphate as stationary phase and buffered water-methanol mixtures, containing perchlorate, as mobile phases. Retention can be selectively influenced by means of the pH, the perchlorate concentration, and the methanol content of the mobile phase, as well as the temperature of the phase system. The compounds of interest can be separated within 10 min and no interference from catecholamines and derivatives was observed. Compared with electrochemical detection, fluorometric detection yielded more favourable detection limits and was more selective when supernatants of brain tissue homogenates were directly injected. Both detection systems showed inadequate selectivity if urine samples were directly injected, but 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid could readily be assayed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6230154	<TITLE>Ultracytochemical localization of Ca++-ATPase activity in the paraphyseal epithelial cells of the frog, Rana esculenta.</TITLE>Ca++-ATPase activity was studied ultracytochemically (cf. Ando et al. 1981) in the paraphysis cerebri of the frog. An intense reaction was demonstrated on the plasmalemma of the microvilli at the apical pole of paraphyseal cells; in contrast, the basolateral plasmalemma showed only a slight staining. In addition, mitochondria, gap junctions, cilia, and cytoplasmic elements (e.g., microfilaments) displayed Ca++-ATPase activity. Variation of the Ca++-concentration in the incubation medium from 0.1 mM to 100 mM altered the Ca++-ATPase activity of the cell organelles. The substitution of Ca- by Mg-ions resulted in a conspicuous decrease in the enzyme activity, especially on the apical plasmalemma. Ca++-ATPase activity is claimed to be involved in a number of extra- and intracellular functions. In comparison to the epithelium of the adjacent choroid plexus the paraphyseal epithelial cell is thought to be a principal Ca-ion regulator of the cerebrospinal fluid in frogs.

6231957	<TITLE>The origin and composition of multiple forms of dextransucrase from Streptococcus sanguis.</TITLE>Multiple forms of purified dextransucrase have been observed in the presence of low detergent concentrations ( Luzio , G.A., Grahame , D. A. and Mayer, R.M. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 216, 751-757). We now show these forms to arise partly as a result of proteolysis, and partly due to incomplete dissociation of the enzyme. Upon 25 degrees C incubation of the crude enzyme, several new bands appeared with little or no change in total activity. The electrophoretic pattern of aged, crude enzyme was similar to that of partially purified enzyme. Specific detection of dextransucrase on SDS gels revealed a single polypeptide of 174 kDa, which is converted to a 156 kDa protein during the aging process. The observation indicates the occurrence of proteolysis. The polypeptide composition of several of the enzyme forms was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Forms Ia and IIa are composed exclusively of 174 kDa polypeptides. Forms III and IVa consist of 156 kDa units, as does the newly observed form Ic. It is likely that form Ib contains both 174 and 156 kDa polypeptides. The results indicate that incomplete dissociation of aggregates of the 174 kDa unit accounts for all of the bands observed on native gels run on fresh culture extracts. Additional enzyme forms result from aggregation of the 156 kDa proteolysis product alone, and from aggregation with unproteolyzed units to form hybrid aggregates.

6271215	<TITLE>Evidence for convertible forms of soluble uterine cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase.</TITLE>The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (3':5'-cyclic nucleotide 5'-nucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.17) systems of many tissues show multiple physical and kinetic forms. In contrast, the soluble rat uterine phosphodiesterase exists as a single enzyme form with non-linear Lineweaver-Burk kinetics for cyclic AMP (app. Km of approx. 3 and 20 microM) and linear kinetics for cyclic GMP (app. Km of approx. 3 microM) since the two hydrolytic activities are not separated by a variety of techniques. In uterine cytosolic fractions, cyclic AMP is a non-competitive inhibitor of cyclic GMP hydrolysis (Ki approx. 32 microM). Also, cyclic GMP is a non-competitive inhibitor of cyclic AMP hydrolysis (Ki approx 16 microM) at low cyclic GMP/cyclic AMP substrate ratios. However, cyclic GMP acts as a competitive inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (Ki approx 34 microM) at high cyclic GMP/cyclic AMP substrate ratios. When a single hydrolytic form of uterine phosphodiesterase, separated initially by DEAE anion-exchange chromatography, is treated with trypsin (0.5 microgram/ml for 2 min) and rechromatographed on DEAE-Sephacel, two major forms of phosphodiesterase are revealed. One form elutes at 0.3 M NaOAc- and displays anomalous kinetics for cyclic AMP hydrolysis (app. Km of 2 and 20 microM) and linear kinetics for cyclic GMP (app. Km approx. 5 microM), kinetic profiles which are similar to those of the uterine cytosolic preparations. A second form of phosphodiesterase elutes at 0.6 M NaOAc- and displays a higher apparent affinity for cyclic AMP (app. Km approx. 1.5 mu) without appreciable cyclic GMP hydrolytic activity. These data provide kinetic and structural evidence that uterine phosphodiesterase contains distinct catalytic sites for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Moreover, they provide further documentation that the multiple forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in mammalian tissues may be conversions from a single enzyme species.

6273942	<TITLE>Inhibitory effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol on glycolytic substrates in the rat testis.</TITLE>Experiments conducted with a rat testicular tissue indicated that delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of glucose metabolism. Incubation of testicular tissue with different U-14C-fructose concentrations and 0.3 mM THC also significantly inhibited 14CO2 production; however, testicular utilization of 214C-pyruvate remained unaffected by THC. In other experiments, 0.3 mM THC significantly decreased tissue concentrations of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate by 23, 31 and 29%, respectively. Uptake studies with 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose showed a 43% reduction in uptake of this substrate by testicular tissue in the presence of 0.3 mM THC. These studies demonstrate that THC has an inhibitory effect on the utilization of energy substrates by the testis. Sites of THC action may be the membrane uptake step, the hexokinase step, and/or possible the phosphofructokinase step. It is proposed that this inhibition of testicular glycolysis could deprive the cells of their energy reserves and thereby may disrupt many gonadal functions.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

6386517	<TITLE>The Medicaid cutoff and abortion services for the poor.</TITLE>Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment's restrictions on federal funding of abortions have prevented poor women from obtaining abortions through the federal Medicaid program. This article describes research undertaken to determine the impact of these restrictions on low-income women. Patients who had Medicaid-funded abortions at a clinic in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977 (when Medicaid funding of abortions was available) were compared with Medicaid-eligible patients who had abortions at the same clinic in 1982 (when public funding of abortions was allowed only if the woman's life would be endangered by continuation of the pregnancy). Their experiences were also compared with those of higher income women attending the same clinic in both years. Finally, some of the 1982 patients were interviewed in 1983 to determine how they went about raising the money that they needed to pay for their abortions. In 1977, Medicaid-eligible patients experienced no delay in obtaining abortions compared with other women, even when demographic differences are considered. However, in 1982, they were significantly delayed; on average, the Medicaid-eligible women who were delayed had abortions 2-3 weeks later than the others. Fifty percent of patients eligible for Medicaid in 1982 had abortions at 10 weeks of gestation or later, compared with 37 percent in 1977. Medicaid-eligible women who were interviewed in depth had abortions about a week later than the other women. Increased delays occurred both between their first suspicion of pregnancy and their pregnancy test and between their decision to have an abortion and the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Mazindol was added to the diet at a level of 10 mg/kg body weight and then all animals were fed on a constantly restricted diet of 60 percent of the level of ad lib, food intake for 10 weeks. The following results were obtained: (1) The body weight and Lee's index were significantly increased by GTG injection and these increases in the GTG-obese group were reduced by oral mazindol. (2) The levels of triglyceride and cholesterol in the liver were much higher in the GTG-obese group than in the lean group, and were significantly less in the mazindol-treated group than in the GTG-obese group. (3) The levels of serum triglyceride and immunoreactive insulin were significantly higher in the GTG group than in the lean group and the increase in the GTG-treated animals was reduced by oral mazindol. (4) The size of fat cells and basal lipolytic activity in parametrial adipose tissue were greater in the GTG-obese group than in the lean group and were significantly reduced by mazindol treatment. (5) Disaccharidase activities in the small intestinal mucosa and the absorptive surface area of the mucosa were significantly greater in the GTG-obese group than in the lean group and were increased significantly less in the mazindol-treated group.

6487807	<TITLE>Two-cycle timed-sequential chemotherapy for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.</TITLE>Based on a series of clinical and laboratory studies of leukemia cell kinetics and responses to chemotherapy, we have developed an intensive timed-sequential regimen of daunorubicin and high-dose infusion 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine for the treatment of adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Of the first 34 patients achieving complete remission (CR) with a single cycle of this therapy, four (12%) remain in complete remission without further therapy after a minimum of five years of follow-up. Treatment of relapsed patients with a second course of the same regimen at relapse and no chemotherapy in second remission increased to seven (21%) the number of patients expected to remain in remission for four years or more from their last chemotherapy. Beginning in 1980, however, we gave all consenting adults a second cycle of this chemotherapy in early first remission. Of the first 25 patients treated with a second cycle of this chemotherapy in early first remission, there was one toxic death, but 11 patients (44%) remain in CR with a median follow-up of almost three years.

6487933	<TITLE>Hyperuricaemia, gout and kidney function in New Zealand Maori men.</TITLE>Several previous studies have demonstrated an increased prevalence of gout in New Zealand Maoris. The aetiology of the hyperuricaemia and its effect on morbidity, apart from gout, are unknown. A survey of 115 Maori men of working age revealed a history of gout in 10 (8%) and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia in 26 (23%). The relationship of hyperuricaemia with obesity was confirmed. Alcohol did not make an obvious contribution to the prevalence of hyperuricaemia. Hypertension was more common and creatinine clearance lower amongst those with gout, but not significantly so. The frequency of hypertension and mean creatinine clearance were similar to that seen in asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and normouricaemia. Urate clearance was lower in the gouty and hyperuricaemic subjects. The normouricaemic Maoris had a reduced fractional urate clearance compared with normal men elsewhere. They also excreted a relatively small proportion of hydrogen as ammonium. Both these features are characteristic of gout, and suggest that the Maoris' susceptibility to hyperuricaemia has a renal mechanism. Obesity is common amongst the Maoris and accentuates their natural tendency to hyperuricaemia.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6524920	<TITLE>We should de-emphasize the importance of the role we give amines in the LH syndrome.</TITLE>Once amines were implicated in the lateral hypothalamic syndrome, it became accepted that the dominant cause of many of its symptoms was an alteration in amines. We suggest that corticofugal fiber damage may produce some of the behavioral symptoms usually attributed to amine alterations.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6541104	<TITLE>Sources of interindividual variations in acetaminophen and antipyrine metabolism.</TITLE>Our goal was to compare and contrast in the same normal twins the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to large interindividual variations in the metabolism of acetaminophen (APAP) and antipyrine. These drugs were selected because they are biotransformed by different mechanisms. A single oral dose of APAP (10 mg/kg) was given to six sets of monozygotic (MZ) and six sets of dizygotic (DZ) twins. All were normal, nonsmoking, nonmedicated, and male. Among these 24 subjects, there were 300% interindividual variations in rate constants for formation of the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, as well as in the overall rate constant for APAP elimination. Intratwin variations for each measurement were as large within MZ as within DZ twinships, suggesting that predominantly environmental rather than genetic factors maintained interindividual variations. Two other observations support this conclusion: Intraindividual variations were frequently as large as interindividual variations, and regardless of zygosity for twins living together, intratwin correlation coefficients were almost twice those of twins living apart. Quite different results were obtained when these twins received antipyrine. After a single oral dose of antipyrine (18 mg/kg), 500% interindividual variations in rate constants for formation of the three main oxidative metabolites of antipyrine appeared to be mainly under genetic control. Also for antipyrine and its principal metabolites, intraindividual variations were much smaller than interindividual variations. In contrast to the results with APAP, regardless of zygosity, intratwin correlation coefficients for antipyrine were similar for twins living apart and twins living together. This comparison between APAP and antipyrine metabolism in the same carefully selected normal twins under apparently uniform environmental conditions reveals that interindividual variations in APAP metabolism arise from certain unidentified environmental factors, whereas genetic factors cause the large interindividual variations that occur in antipyrine disposition.

6600878	<TITLE>Estimating proportionate changes in rates.</TITLE>Quantitative measures are defined for use in health policy formulation. Consider a dichotomized risk factor for a specific disease or a protective factor known to promote health. A health policy that alters the prevalence of exposure to the factor will create corresponding proportionate changes in the disease rate and in the health rate. Statistical formulas are presented for estimating such proportionate changes. Formulas are given for cohort, case-control, and some hybrid study designs, but only for those studies where it is appropriate to present the data in a 2 X 2 table. It is assumed that the population is stable and that all subjects are observed over the same fixed time interval. Formulas for estimating the standard error of the estimate are also provided.

6608012	<TITLE>A case of variant angina and myocardial infarction 6 months after successful bypass surgery.</TITLE>A 61-year-old man with variant angina underwent bypass surgery to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) which had a 90% narrowing in the proximal segment. The postoperative course was favorable, but 6 months after surgery, the calcium antagonist, diltiazem, with which the patient had been continuously treated since surgery, was stopped because of hepatitis. Immediately after discontinuation of the calcium antagonist, the patient had an acute anterior myocardial infarction. An angiogram demonstrated a patent graft and an anteroapical infarction. The infarction is thought to have been caused by a severe, prolonged spasm of the LAD distal to the graft or diffuse spasm of the LAD throughout its entire length. Thus, after bypass surgery calcium antagonists should be given continuously to patients with variant forms of angina pectoris.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6688178	<TITLE>Regulation of methionine-enkephalin precursor messenger RNA in rat striatum by haloperidol and lithium.</TITLE>Daily injections of rats with haloperidol for 21 days or lithium chloride for 5 days elevated the content of Met-enkephalin in the striatum by 86% or 66%, respectively. Poly(A)+ RNA from striata of drug-treated and control rats was translated in vitro, and the amount of synthesized enkephalin precursor [35S]preproenkephalin A was determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Haloperidol or lithium treatment increased the relative amount of preproenkephalin A synthesized by 67-98% or 25-29%, respectively. These results suggest that haloperidol elevates the Met-enkephalin content primarily by increasing the precursor mRNA content or activity, while lithium exerts its effect only in part by this mechanism.

Separation and quantitation are performed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. A sample size of 100 microL or less is required for detection of concentrations as low as 1 to 2 ng/mL. In trials with standard solutions, recovery was 75%. The between-run and within-run coefficients of variation were 7.3% (over the range of 5 to 200 ng/mL) and 9.1% (at 5 ng/mL), respectively.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6751389	<TITLE>Acrylamide and oxygen fluorescence quenching studies with liver alcohol dehydrogenase using steady-state and phase fluorometry.</TITLE>The fluorescence lifetime of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) has been determined by phase fluorometry at various emission wavelengths and as a function of the concentration of the quencher acrylamide. Acrylamide selectively quenches the fluorescence of the surface tryptophanyl residue Trp-15, thus allowing the fluorescence lifetime of this residue and the buried residue Trp-314 to be evaluated. Values of tau15 = 6.9 ns and tau314 = 3.6 ns are obtained, in qualitative agreement with lifetimes of these residues determined from fluorescence decay studies [Ross, J.B.A., Schmidt, C.J., & Brand, L. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 4369-4377]. The quenching of the fluorescence of LADH by oxygen has also been studied. Quenching by oxygen results in a blue shift in the fluorescence of the protein and a downward-curving Stern-Volmer plot. These data, along with oxygen quenching studies in the presence of 1 M acrylamide, are consistent with a model in which oxygen quenches the fluorescence of Trp-314 and -15 with quenching constants of 3.5 and 25 M-1, respectively. Thus, as in studies with other quenchers, Trp-314 is found to be less accessible to the quencher oxygen than is Trp-15. A lifetime Stern-Volmer plot has also been obtained for the oxygen quenching of LADH. Such a plot deviates somewhat from the intensity Stern-Volmer plot as predicted by simulations of the quenching of two-component systems.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6771058	<TITLE>Immunonephelometric assay of human apolipoprotein AI.</TITLE>We report an immunonephelometric assay for apolipoprotein AI, which involves use of a laser nephelometer and an antiserum prepared in our laboratory. Coefficients of variation were 2.5% within-run, 6.3% between-run. Several types of manipulation of the samples (heating, delipidation, dissociation with urea), reportedly necessary for accurate determinations by radioimmunoassay or gel diffusion immunoassay, did not substantially affect results obtained with our technique. The assay is sensitive, reproducible, and simple, and appears suitable for routine use.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

A further survey showed that the prevalence within mouse, rat, guineapig and rabbit colonies varied between 25 and 95%. Guineapigs housed with infected rabbits are at a greater risk of being infected than those housed separately. Nephritis was a common feature, but cerebral granulomata were not seen.

6862676	<TITLE>On the flow of medical information through a hospital registration post.</TITLE>The health status of any inpatient of the Geneva hospital is appraised 3 times as follows: once before hospitalisation, then while registering, and last at discharge from hospital. Data about these 3 examinations were gathered in the registration post and then coded. The number of recorded ailments and their contents were statistically analysed. There is a notable increase in the number of diagnosed ailments and a large agreement about their nature. Simple models to describe the relations between those 2 variables were investigated, but turned up to be somewhat unsatisfying. Throughout the paper due allowance is made for a distinction between medicosurgical ailments and more specialised ones.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
6872417	<TITLE>Cimetidine impairs nitrazepam clearance.</TITLE>The effect of cimetidine on hepatic clearance of the benzodiazepine derivative nitrazepam was evaluated in healthy subjects. Six received a single 5- or 10-mg oral nitrazepam dose in the drug-free state and again with therapeutic cimetidine doses. Nitrazepam kinetics were determined from multiple serum concentrations measured during the 72 hr after each dose. Cimetidine had no effect on nitrazepam absorption kinetics, since peak serum nitrazepam concentration and time of peak concentration were not altered. Cimetidine did not alter nitrazepam volume of distribution, but cimetidine consistently reduced nitrazepam clearance, from a mean of 1.41 ml/min/kg in the control state to 1.17 ml/min/kg during cimetidine treatment. This resulted in prolongation of nitrazepam elimination t1/2 from 22.2 to 27.8 hr. Thus the ability of cimetidine to impair drug oxidation in man extends to the capacity for clearance of nitrazepam, a compound biotransformed mainly by nitroreduction.

6942404	<TITLE>Internal duplication and evolution of human ceruloplasmin.</TITLE>With the completion of the primary structure of the 50,000- and 19,000-dalton fragments of human ceruloplasmin [ferroxidase; iron(II):oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.16.3.1], over half of the covalent structure of the single polypeptide chain of this protein is known. Visual and computer analysis of the sequence of the 564 amino acid residues in the two fragments gives clear evidence of statistically significant internal homology suggestive of evolutionary replication of two smaller units. Two homology regions, each composed of 224 residues, were defined by an intrasequence alignment that required only three gaps in each 224-residue segment. The two homology regions exhibited 43% identity in sequence, and 13% of the remaining positions had similar residues. The sequence of a 160-residue segment in ceruloplasmin exhibits significant homology to the active (copper-binding) sites of blue electron-transfer proteins such as azurins and plastocyanins and multicopper oxidases such as cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase. It is proposed that a primitive ceruloplasmin gene was formed by the fusion of two genes coding, respectively, for protein abut 160 and 190 amino acid residues in length and that this precursor gene coding for about 350 amino acids was later triplicated to form the gene for the present-day ceruloplasmin molecule of about 1050 amino acids.

6950460	<TITLE>Interaction between prostaglandins of the E-type with a urinary component from halothane anesthetized rats.</TITLE>Prostaglandins of the E-type (PGE's) were found to react or combine with a urinary metabolite of Halothane yielding products which were left unrecovered during the purification procedure preceding specific radioimmunoassay of PGE2. The products were retained on sephadex LH-20 columns, and showed on thin layer silica gel plates (TLC) Rf values lower than those of the parent PGE-compounds. The product formation is supposed to involve the beta-hydroxyketone system of PGE, since PG's of the F and A type were unaffected. The product formation could be avoided by inducing anaesthesia with Hexobarbitone and maintaining the anaesthesia with Halothane-nitrous oxide or it could be reversed by adding barbiturates to urine samples obtained from animals anaesthetized with Halothane-nitrous oxide alone. The barbiturates effectively competed with PGE for the metabolite leaving PGE to behave normally on sephadex LH-20 and TLC, thus enabling us to evaluate correctly the PGE2 content by RIA.

6963968	<TITLE>Studies of antigenic components of the human syncytiotrophoblast membrane.</TITLE>In order to initiate characterization of potentially immunogenic moieties on the human trophoblast membrane, antisera to native and detergent-solubilized normal trophoblast membranes were prepared in rabbits. By indirect immunofluorescence, these antisera reacted strongly with all villous structures in normal placentae and also with a panel of normal adult human tissues. Specificities to normal human serum components were then removed by solid-phase immunoabsorption. However, the resultant antisera still reacted weakly with differentiated, normal adult tissues, and additional absorption with normal adult liver homogenate was necessary to remove cross-reactivity completely. Such absorbed antisera gave undiminished and specific fluorescence of the syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane, and specifically precipitated two protein species with approximate relative molecular masses of 148,000 and 62,000. However, they also reacted with PHA-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes, in addition to Chang liver and HeLa cell lines. These results indicate that, even after extensive absorption, trophoblast membrane antisera may retain reactivity for determinants shared with normal and transformed adult cells.

6985025	<TITLE>Self-reported drug use among secondary school students in two rapidly developing Nigerian towns.</TITLE>A 32-item standardized multiple-choice and open-ended questionnaire was completed by nearly 500 male and female secondary school students in two rapidly developing Nigerian towns. About two thirds of the students reported some exposure to alcohol, and about one quarter reported some experience with tobacco. There was much less use of caffeine, methaqualone in combination with diphenhydramine, 2-ethylamino-3-phenylorcamphane in combination with vitamins, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, cannabis and dexamphetamine. Many students fell into the "past use" category. Parents were extremely disapproving of the use of almost any drug. Many students supported stronger penalties for the use of cannabis. Non-users claimed that drugs were dangerous to health. In addition, religious beliefs were associated with abstinence from drugs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7004627	<TITLE>Use of polyestradiol phosphate and anti-17 beta estradiol antibodies for the localization of estrogen receptors in target tissues: a critique.</TITLE>Polyestradiol phosphate (PEP) has been used for localization of estrogen receptors in human carcinoma. The nature of PEP binding to the receptor molecule and the ability of antiestradiol antibodies to react with estrogen receptor complexes were investigated, using an animal model system. Castrated adult female rats were injected with PEP, estradiol 17 beta-diethylstilbestrol or saline. An estrogen target organ (uterus) and a non-target organ (diaphragm) were removed from each animal. In each organ, unoccupied cytosolic estrogen receptors were quantified by DCC assay. The tissue sections were processed to ascertain the PEP binding and the ability of antiestradiol antibodies to detect hormone-occupied sites. Comparison of the results obtained by DCC assay and immunohistochemical technique revealed that antiestradiol antibodies do not react with estradiol receptor complexes formed in vitro or in vivo; that PEP cannot compete with estradiol for the receptor sites in vitro; and that PEP binds to proteins other than those measured by DCC as receptor molecules having high affinity for estradiol.

Seven isolates were motile at 25 and 37 degrees C in all media, and the presence of flagellated cells was demonstrated by a flagellum stain. Six isolates were nonmotile at both temperatures in all media, and no flagella were observed. Identification schemes for Y. enterocolitica should reflect these possibilities.

7077537	<TITLE>The role of dopamine and serotonin in the discriminative stimulus effects of lisuride.</TITLE>The discriminative stimulus properties of the clinically important ergot derivative lisuride hydrogen maleate (LHM) were investigated by training groups of rats (13 per group) to discriminate either of three training doses of LHM (0.02, 0.08 or 0.32 mg/kg) from saline. Dose-response tests showed that the three LHM cues were specific to the dose used during training and the dose-response curve became more steep as the training dose increased. In substitution tests, the direct dopamine (DA) agonists apomorphine and lergotrile substituted for LHM and the potency order of the LHM-like effect (LHM greater than apomorphine greater than lergotrile) corresponded to previous electrophysiological and biochemical results. The indirect DA agonist d-amphetamine did not substitute for LHM. The direct serotonin (5-HT) agonists quipazine, MK-212 and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced dose-dependent, but incomplete, substitution for LHM which covaried with LHM training dose. In antagonism tests, only drug capable of blocking DA receptors, haloperidol and methiothepin, attenuated the LHM cues; the 5-HT antagonists cyproheptadine, BC-105 and xylamidine were ineffective. These data indicate that the primary neuronal action mediating the discriminative stimulus effects of a wide range of LHM doses was direct activation of central DA receptors. The 5-HT agonist actions of LHM proved to be secondary in that 5-HT agonists substituted only partially for LHM and 5-HT antagonists failed to attenuate LHM cues.

7137735	<TITLE>Induced vasodilation as treatment for Raynaud's disease.</TITLE>We examined the efficacy of induced vasodilation as a treatment of idiopathic Raynaud's disease. Eight persons with Raynaud's disease and seven normal persons each received 27 simultaneous pairings of hand immersion in warm water (43 degrees C) for 10 minutes with exposure of the whole body to cold (0 degrees C). A second group of seven normal persons and nine persons with Raynaud's disease received no treatments. All subjects had cold test exposures (0 degrees C) at the start and end of the study. Subjects with Raynaud's disease who received treatments showed significant increases in digital temperatures (2.2 degrees C) during the cold test compared with the values of untreated subjects with Raynaud's disease (p less than 0.05); normal subjects who had received treatments showed no difference from those who had not. Digital temperatures of subjects with Raynaud's disease after treatment increased to levels approaching those of normal subjects, although they showed lower digital temperatures during initial exposure to cold (p less than 0.01). This therapy offers a practical alternative to traditional treatments.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

This paper describes the purification of glycoprotein DE, which constitutes 40% of SEP, and the identification and semiquantitative determination of the sugars forming its oligosaccharide chain. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-Concanavalin A produced a sample of D-E 95% pure in which 10.5 g of sugar were present per 100 g protein. The percentual composition of the oligosaccharide was D-mannose 19%; D-galactose 3%; N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 33%; N-acetyl-neuraminic acid 31% and D-glucose 13%.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7205265	<TITLE>Lumiflavin and lumichrome transport in the central nervous system.</TITLE>The transport of the lipid-soluble sugarless flavins, [14C]lumiflavin and [14C]lumichrome, into an from the isolated choroid plexus and brain slices was studied in vitro. The isolated choroid plexus accumulated both [14C]flavins by a saturable, energy-requiring process that did not depend on binding or intracellular metabolism of the [14C]flavins. Both sugar-containing and sugarless flavins, as well as cyclic organic acids, significantly inhibited [14C]lumiflavin and [14C]lumichrome uptake by the isolated choroid plexus. Within 2.5 min, 75% of the [14C]lumiflavin accumulated by the isolated choroid plexus was released into the medium. Brain slices accumulated [14C]lumiflavin by a saturable process that did not meet all the criteria for active transport. Ninety-five percent of the [14C]lumiflavin accumulated by brain slices was released into the medium within 7.5 min. In vivo, 2 h after the intraventricular injection of 6.5 nmol [14C]lumiflavin, almost all of the [14C]flavin was cleared from the CNS. Addition of 3.5 mumol FMN to the intraventricular injectate significantly decreased the clearance of [14C]lumiflavin from the CNS. These studies document that the sugarless flavins are transported by the flavin transport systems in the CNS.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7238119	<TITLE>Electron microscope studies on the effects of dimethyl sulphoxide in mammary glands of Long Evan rats during foetalogeneis.</TITLE>The effects of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in mammary glands of rats during foetalogeneis was studied by means of electron microscopy. Certain morphological alterations were observed in secretory tubules and epithelial cels of mammary glands. These alterations were not evident in control tissues. Secretory tubules of DMSO-treated mammary glands showed dissociation, thickening of granular fibrous-like material and profound darkening. Morphological alterations observed in epithelial cells involved decrease and dissociation of fibrillar complexes, numerous electron-dense droplets, mitochondria with disrupted cristae, hypertrophied granular endoplasmic reticuli, vacuoles and cellular debris. Thus, the results in this study suggest that DMSO at sublethal dosages induces morphological alterations in mammary gland tissue of rats during 16.5 days of gestation.

The organophosphorus compound was extracted from the biological sample with ethyl acetate and analysed on a carbowax 20M fused-silica capillary column with a nitrogen-phosphorus specific detector. O,S,S-Triethylphosphorodithioate was used as an internal standard added to the sample before extraction. The sensitivity of the method allowed the compound to be measured in 0.1-ml aliquots of plasma or in 20-mg wet weight of tissue down to a level of 5 ng/sample. The method has been applied to a pharmacokinetic study in the rat after an oral or intravenous dosage with 25 mg/kg of O,S,S-trimethylphosphorodithioate.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

7377363	<TITLE>Effect of body hypothermia on transventricular simple-capacitor-discharge defibrillation thresholds.</TITLE>In 260 successful transventricular simple capacitor-discharge defibrillations performed on 20 mongrel dogs under conditions of body hypothermia, an overall average peak current threshold of 69.5 mA/g of heart (SD 30.4) was found. This value, when compared by means of the unpaired t test with previous data obtained under conditions of relative normothermia (89.5 mA/g of heart, SD 32.8, 346 defibrillations, 20 dogs) yielded a highly significant difference (P less than 0.1%). When comparing the deviation of the regression equation (current vs. temperature) from the horizontal line, the Snedecor F test gave also a high level of significance (P less than 1%). These results led to the conclusion that body hypothermia significantly reduces transventricular defibrillation thresholds. After normalizing the regression equations, this reduction was found to be on the average equal to 4.1%/degrees C (SD 1.4) for current and to 5.9%/degrees C (SD 1.4) for energy over the 20 dogs. In all animals, the coefficient of variation was greater for energy than for current (about twice as much), suggesting that current is a better descriptor of what is needed for electrical defibrillation. The transventricular impedance was rather constant, yielding an overall average of 28.5 omega (SD 6.0).	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

7451787	<TITLE>The depressed patient: social antecedents of psychopathologic changes in the elderly.</TITLE>The importance of depression as a psychopathologic syndrome in the elderly is stressed by the estimate that about 30 percent of persons over the age of 65 may be expected to experience an episode of depression severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Depression is the chief cause of psychiatric hospitalization among the elderly, and it bears great potential for death through inanition or suicide. Loss of mastery (ability to cope) and the onset of helplessness are frequent dynamic issues in the development of depression or behavioral problems in the elderly. Geriatric stereotypes contribute directly to helplessness by reinforcing such behavior. Stereotypes also minimize the chance of appropriate response outcomes relative to needs. Rolelessness, a partial result of stereotyping, leads to anomie, alienation, and lowered self-esteem. These issues are discussed and points of interaction among them are examined. The relevance to psychotherapy with older persons is outlined.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

SALT-3 showed atypical T cell markers such as CD1-CD2-CD3-CD4+CD5+CD7+CD8-CD19-CD20-CD25+HLA-DR+. T cell receptor alpha/beta and gamma/delta were undetectable. Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) particles were seen on SALT-3 cells by electron microscopic analysis. HTLV-I gag p19, proviral DNA and mRNA of HTLV-I genes were also detected in the cells. Chromosome analysis showed abnormal karyotypes as 47, XY, partial trisomy of No.3 chromosome, and trisomy of No. 7 chromosome. Furthermore, SALT-3 were susceptible to the infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the cells were rapidly killed after HIV-1 infection. This newly established HTLV-I-infected human T cell line would be a useful tool to study biological activities of atypical type of ATL cells and to examine the cytotoxic effects of HIV-1 and it's modulators.

7569302	<TITLE>What are the educational needs of prospective family caregivers of newly disabled adults?</TITLE>What are the needs of family caregivers of newly disabled adults? Research to date has focused on the needs of family members of patients in critical care units and of family members who have been in the caregiver role at home for some time. No studies could be found on the perceptions of individuals facing the decision to assume the family caregiver role for a newly disabled adult anticipating discharge from a physical rehabilitation or medical-surgical nursing unit. Watson's philosophy of science and caring provided the theoretical basis for this study. The Elaine Matthis Educational Wants of Family Caregivers of Disabled Adults Questionnaire was used to assess the perceptions of prospective family caregivers visiting newly disabled adults in an urban medical center. The results of this research are offered to help nurses understand the feelings of uncertainty about the new and unexpected role that family caregivers face and to help nurses meet the needs of families preparing to take disabled adult relatives home.

7604787	<TITLE>Treatment of combined hyperlipidemia with fluvastatin and gemfibrozil, alone or in combination, does not induce muscle damage.</TITLE>Although combination therapy using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-Co-A) reductase inhibitors and fibrates is efficacious in combined hyperlipidemia, such treatment has been associated with myopathy. For this reason, we studied the effects of fluvastatin and gemfibrozil, alone or in combination, on muscle. A total of 21 patients with combined hyperlipidemia were recruited who were matched for age, body mass index, and baseline levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, creatine phosphokinase, and myoglobin. Patients were randomized to three groups for 6-week treatment with fluvastatin at 40 mg/day, gemfibrozil at 600 mg twice daily, or a combination of the two drugs. Parameters for muscle damage were rises in levels of serum creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin compared with pre-exercise levels; these were assessed 1 hr and 8 hr after a 45 min lean body mass standardized ergometer test, which was performed before and after treatment in all patients. Biopsies from the quadriceps muscle were taken 48 hr after each test. Fluvastatin lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C by 23% and 35%, respectively (p < 0.01), with no effects on triglycerides and HDL-C. Gemfibrozil lowered triglycerides by 40% (p < 0.01) but did not lower total cholesterol or LDL-C significantly. The combination therapy decreased total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides by 28%, 29%, and 39%, respectively (p < 0.05).

Under the influence of ovarian steroids, endometrium undergoes a cyclical pattern of proliferation followed by secretory differentiation. Since retinoids promote the differentiation of many epithelia to secretory phenotypes they may be involved in controlling the secretory differentiation of human endometrial epithelium. Cytosolic binding proteins for retinol (cellular retinol binding protein) and retinoic acid (cellular retinoic acid binding protein) may play an important part in regulating the availability of retinoic acid to its nuclear receptors and we have therefore asked whether expression of mRNA for these proteins varies in relation to endometrial differentiation. In a series of 54 endometrial biopsies, both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells expressed mRNA for cellular retinol binding protein type I at a constant level throughout the menstrual cycle. Cellular retinoic acid binding protein type II was also expressed but the level of expression varied dramatically, being elevated in the proliferative phase and depressed during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle in both epithelial and stromal cells. These data suggest that cytosolic binding proteins modulate the supply of retinoic acid to the nuclei of endometrial cells during the menstrual cycle and that retinoic acid is involved in the cyclical control of endometrial differentiation.

7687510	<TITLE>Cutaneous IgE-mediated inflammatory lesion size is inhibited by an H1 antagonist (terfenadine) while mediator release is unaffected in vivo and in vitro.</TITLE>We are interested in understanding the pathogenesis of the cutaneous IgE-mediated late phase reaction. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study with 10 subjects of the effect of the non-sedating antihistamine, terfenadine (Selddane), on the cutaneous reaction to antigen (ragweed or mixed grass) administered intradermally and over denuded blister bases was performed. The activity of terfenadine on anti-IgE-induced mediator release from the skin mast cell, lung mast cell and basophil was also examined in vitro. Terfenadine significantly inhibited the size of the cutaneous reaction at every hour between hours 1 and 9 (hr 9, control 2250 +/- 500 mm2 vs drug 1250 +/- 250 mm2, P < 0.01, n = 10) and showed some inhibitory effect at hours 10-12. While terfenadine blocks histamine release after nasal antigen challenge the release of mediators at skin blister sites was unaffected. The infiltration of leucocytes into the blister supernatant was unaffected by terfenadine although previous studies have shown significant inhibition with another antihistamine, cetirizine. In vitro, terfenadine, like other antihistamines, was found to have inhibitory activity on anti-IgE-induced mediator release at concentrations of 10(-4)-10(-5) M in lung and skin mast cells and basophils. We conclude that the effects of the newer antihistamines on cellular movement into the skin may be diverse, that terfenadine may show organ specificity in vivo and that terfenadine significantly decreases both the early and late gross inflammatory response of the skin to antigen. We cannot, as yet, explain the mechanism(s) by which this occurs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7701421	<TITLE>Unintended "incidental" durotomy during surgery of the lumbar spine: medicolegal implications.</TITLE>A review of 146 medical malpractice cases involving surgery of the lumbar spine disclosed that unintended "incidental" durotomy (23 cases) was the second most frequently named occurrence. In each instance there was an associated alleged complication or sequelae. There appears to be a subset of patients in whom an unintended "incidental" durotomy is associated with perioperative morbidity and long-term sequelae. Considering the frequency with which a dural tear is listed as one of the complaints in medical malpractice cases involving surgery of the lumbar spine, it cannot be considered an entirely "benign event."

7730633	<TITLE>5-Fluorocytosine-induced eradication of murine adenocarcinomas engineered to express the cytosine deaminase suicide gene requires host immune competence and leaves an efficient memory.</TITLE>The nonmammalian cytosine deaminase (CD) enzyme converts the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the toxic metabolite 5-fluorouracil. Parental cells of a mammary adenocarcinoma (TSA-pc) of BALB/c mice were transfected with the CD gene (TSA-CD), and the ability of 5-FC to hamper their growth was evaluated. A quantity amounting to 0.5 mg of 5-FC/0.3 ml of medium inhibits the proliferation of TSA-CD cells, but not that of TSA-pc, nor that of TSA-pc transfected with neomycin-resistance gene only (TSA-neo). In BALB/c mice, 800 mg 5-FC/kg of body weight injected daily i.p. for 30 days causes total regression of incipient (1-day-old), and established (3- and 7-day-old) TSA-CD tumors, and of 3-day-old experimental lung metastases, but does not impair TSA-pc nor TSA-neo cell growth. Because in CD8+ T lymphocyte- and granulocyte-depleted mice 5-FC no longer impairs TSA-CD growth, immune mechanisms appear to play an important role in this regression. Following, regression, all mice are resistant to subsequent s.c. or i.v. lethal challenges with TSA-pc. The induction of this immune memory is dependent on CD4+ lymphocytes, whereas its effector phase depends on both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. The memory elicited in tumor-bearing mice by the 5-FC-dependent regression of TSA-CD tumors cures a significant number of mice with 4-day-old TSA-pc metastases, but does not impair the growth of 4-day-old solid s.c. tumors. The reliability of this regression and the subsequent establishment of an efficient immune memory against poorly immunogenic TSA-pc offer the prospect that CD-transduced tumor cells and 5-FC can be used as components of a live antitumor vaccine.

7742131	<TITLE>Artefacts caused by dental filling materials in MR imaging.</TITLE>An investigation regarding possible artefacts from dental filling materials in MR imaging is presented including 9 types of such materials from various manufacturers. Freshly extracted teeth were prepared and the filling materials were handled according to manufacturers' instructions. The teeth were encapsulated into a gel phantom based on de-ionized water, Ni (NO3)2 and polysaccharide agarose powder. The investigation was performed with a standard head coil and a 1.5 T MR unit. Images acquired with various combinations of parameters from different sequences were visually analysed regarding possible artefacts. The investigation showed that only one of the materials caused significant artefacts. The gel phantom was found to be a valuable means for examination of artefacts from small samples, and can be recommended as a standard technique for this purpose.

7749377	<TITLE>Tissue kallikrein in rat and mouse neurons.</TITLE>1. The distribution of tissue kallikrein in the rat brain was investigated by an immunohistochemical technique using antiserum against rat urinary kallikrein. The kallikrein-immunoreactive cells were widespread and scattered in both the cerebral cortex and brain stem, and the immunoreactive substance appeared to be preferentially localized around the neuronal cell body and their processes. 2. Furthermore, in order to define whether brain kallikrein levels vary in the aging process, the hydrolyzing activity in the cerebrum L-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA) was measured in young (7-week old) and old (36-week old) female senescence accelerated mice (SAM-P/8 and SAM-R/1). The brain kallikrein levels of 7- as well as 36-week old SAM-P/8 were found to be lower than those of 7-week old SAM-R/1 (a control strain). Also, the brain kallikrein level of 36-week old SAM-R/1 animals was markedly reduced when compared with the 7-week old mice, suggesting that the reduced amount of cerebral kallikrein reflects the aging of the brain.

7759562	<TITLE>Comodulation of cellular polyamines and proliferation: biomarker application to colorectal mucosa.</TITLE>Polyamines are low molecular weight aliphatic amines required for normal cellular growth which are ubiquitously found in all living tissues. Polyamine biosynthesis is known to increase with mitogenesis, and elevated polyamine concentrations are found in hyperproliferative tissues. Quantitation of tissue polyamine content may thus provide a biochemical measure of proliferation, with potential biomarker application to the colonic mucosa where dysregulated epithelial proliferation is associated with cancer risk. This study was performed to validate polyamine analyses as a measure of cellular proliferation, and to preliminarily assess polyamine characteristics when applied to clinical samples. Using FHC, a human colonic epithelial cell line, for in vitro experimentation, deoxycholic acid or retinol was added to freshly passaged cultures to either stimulate or inhibit proliferation, respectively. Parallel cultures were then assayed for (1) proliferation by sulforhodamine B staining; and (2) polyamine content by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Deoxycholic acid stimulated, and retinol inhibited proliferation in dose-dependent fashion. Polyamine content, specifically the spermidine content and the spermidine/spermine ratio, also increased or decreased in response to culture with deoxycholic acid or retinol, respectively. Significant linear correlations between proliferation and spermidine (r = 0.858, P < 0.001), and with the spermidine/spermine ratio (r = 0.574, P < 0.05) were observed. When quantitative polyamine analyses were applied to human colonic specimens, replicate mucosal sampling revealed a high degree of intra-individual variability, indicating a heterogeneous distribution of polyamines within anatomically confined colonic segments. The results support a role for quantitative polyamine analyses as a correlative measure of colonic epithelial proliferation; however, intraindividual variability may limit the utility of colorectal biomarker measurements.

Knowledge, beliefs, and practices of physicians.</TITLE>To assess physicians' knowledge and beliefs regarding communication with deaf people and compare their knowledge and beliefs with their methods of communicating with deaf patients in their practices.|Survey.|University medical center.|Attending physicians in an internal medicine department.|Physicians were surveyed regarding prior contacts with deaf patients and with deaf people outside the medical setting, and regarding their knowledge and beliefs concerning methods of communicating with deaf people. Physicians were asked to estimate the fraction of encounters in which they communicated with deaf patients by lipreading, writing, translation by a relative or friend, a sign language interpreter, or other methods.|Writing was the method used most frequently in communicating with deaf patients. Although 63% of physicians knew that signing should be the initial method of communicating with deaf patients who sign, only 22% used sign language interpreters more frequently than other methods in their practices. Past contact with deaf people (P = .05), belief that communication by signing was the best means of communication (P = .04), and knowledge of the inefficiency of lipreading (P = .04) were predictors of the use of sign language interpreters for deaf patients. Physicians who used sign language interpreters more frequently than other methods believed that much more time and effort were involved in caring for deaf than for hearing patients compared with those who used interpreters less frequently (P = .08).|Although most physicians believed that use of sign language interpreters was preferable, only a minority used them in their practices. Greater recognition of the advantages of signing over other methods and greater availability of sign language interpreters should lead to more effective communication between deaf patients and physicians.

7891858	<TITLE>Chronic mild acidosis specifically reduces functional expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and increases long-term survival in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells.</TITLE>Previous studies suggest that chronic depolarization by addition of 25 mM KCl or N-methyl-D-aspartate to primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells promotes expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor, as determined by electrophysiological responsiveness and susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Recent studies have demonstrated that acute mild acidosis reduces N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel activity by a non-competitive action of H+ on an extracellular site of the receptor channel complex. Since the level of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression in granule cell cultures is activity-dependent, we examined whether chronic mildly acidotic culture conditions would selectively diminish the level of N-methyl-D-aspartate responsiveness in granule cells, in effect producing a functional level of expression more comparable to that observed in vivo. To test this, cerebellar granule cells from eight-day neonatal rats were grown in an HCO3-buffered medium containing elevated K+ (25 mM KCl) either under standard conditions (95% air/5% CO2, pH 7.4), or under chronic mildly acidotic conditions (90% air/10% CO2, estimated pH of 7.1). Glutamate receptor subtype expression was subsequently assessed using standard neurotoxicity assays, a quantitative immunoblotting assay for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and whole cell patch clamp recordings. Cells grown in the 10% CO2 environment exhibited a significant reduction in susceptibility to L-glutamate neurotoxicity (at least 10-fold), but not kainate-induced neurotoxicity, relative to cells grown in 5% CO2. In both culture conditions, L-glutamate- and kainate-induced toxicity were mediated by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, respectively, as determined by the sensitivity of agonist-induced toxicity to specific receptor antagonists. Using polyclonal antibodies generated against a peptide sequence recognizing five of eight splice variants in the common "R1" subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, a 31% reduction in the amount of immunoreactive protein was observed in membrane preparations from cells grown in 10% CO2, relative to the amount detected in cells grown in 5% CO2. Moreover, perfusion of cells with glutamate (50 microM) in a nominally Mg(2+)-free solution containing glycine (2 microM) elicited N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-sensitive inward currents in proportionately fewer cells cultured in 10% CO2, relative to cells cultured in 5% CO2. Long-term survival was also significantly enhanced in cells exposed chronically to mild acidotic culture conditions, relative to cells grown under standard pH conditions (22 days, 10% CO2 vs 16 days, 5% CO2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7898168	<TITLE>Volume versus wiring transmission in the brain: a new theoretical frame for neuropsychopharmacology.</TITLE>A volume transmission mode of communication in brain was implicit already in the early work of Golgi, who postulated the existence of electrical signals in the extracellular fluid (ECF) based on Volta's "wet conductor" made by solutions. The term volume transmission is taken from the term volume conduction describing the flow of ionic currents in the ECF as a basis for the electrocorticogram. The slow VT mode includes also chemical signals and is opposed to the fast synaptic (wiring) transmission. Every neuron may function in a dual mode, the synaptic and the volume transmission mode, when considering the autocrine and synaptic classes of communication. The paracrine- and neuroendocrine-like classes only involve the VT mode in the latter case including the CSF as a route. The chemical signals for VT are the neuropeptides, but also the classical transmitters, the monoamines, acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate can participate, when they operate via slow, high affinity G protein coupled receptors. Ions such as K+, Ca++, and H+ also function as VT signals. The hypothesis is also introduced that CO2 can act as a multifacit long-distance VT and WT regulator besides being part of the CO2/HCO3 buffer. CO2 via regulating NMDA receptor sensitivity can also regulate NO formation, which represents a paracrine and fast VT signal. The therapy of CNS disorders is also discussed in the frame of the wiring and VT concept. Two therapeutical approaches can therefore be developed, one based on increasing WT and one based on increasing VT. In contrast to the WT therapy, which must preserve the electrotemporal code, the VT therapy can operate also with postsynaptic agonists. Therefore, a therapeutic effect with such a drug indicates that the deficiency in the communication process operates via VT. In view of the lack of very effective negative feedbacks in VT vs. WT, VT therapy may produce less tolerance and drug dependency.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The effect almost disappeared in PC12 variant cells deficient in synaptotagmin I, a synaptic vesicle protein, and was rescued by transfecting the synaptotagmin I gene. These results indicate that synaptotagmin I is essential for the Ca(2+)-independent action of alpha-latrotoxin in PC12 cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
7970589	<TITLE>Treatment of Candida-infected denture stomatitis with a miconazole lacquer.</TITLE>The efficacy of a topically administered miconazole denture lacquer was compared with that of a placebo lacquer in the treatment of Candida-infected denture stomatitis. The study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial with two parallel treatment groups. The lacquer was applied once on the fitting denture surface. Follow-up examinations took place on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. On day 14 the effect of the treatment was assessed. Thirty-six patients were included in the statistical analysis. Eighteen received miconazole and 18 received placebo lacquer. Primary efficacy endpoints were the number of colonies cultured from the palatal mucosa and denture surface on day 14. Thirteen of 16 patients in the miconazole group A showed < 10 colonies on culture medium on day 14 in the specimens from the palatal mucosa as did 5 of 18 patients in the placebo group B (p < 0.05). Corresponding results for the denture surface were 6 of 17 and 3 of 18, respectively (p < 0.05). Reapplication of lacquer was considered necessary (> 100 colonies in at least one sampling site within 14 days) in 35% of the patients from group A and in 83% of the patients from group B. The results indicate that a single application of a miconazole denture lacquer considerably reduces the number of Candida yeasts for a substantial period of time.

7992975	<TITLE>Coexistent abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal carcinoma: management options.</TITLE>Renal carcinoma (RCA) presenting in association with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is extremely rare, with only sporadic case reports previously described. The management of six cases of AAA and concomitant RCA presenting to a single institution from March, 1991 through December, 1993 was reviewed and management options considered. AAAs ranged in size from 4.5-7.0 cm (mean, 5.6 cm). Three left renal carcinomas were resected via a retroperitoneal approach simultaneous to repair of the AAA. One right renal carcinoma was resected in combination with repair of an AAA through a transperitoneal approach. The fifth case was managed by left nephrectomy, followed by interval aneurysmectomy, and the sixth case was managed by nonsurgical methods because of the presence of widely metastatic disease. Renal malignancies included five renal cell carcinomas and one transitional cell carcinoma. Three patients remain free of disease 8-11 months postoperatively, and one patient had metastatic disease detected 19 months postoperatively. Two deaths have occurred; one due to a massive CVA 1 month following a combined aneurysmectomy and left nephrectomy, and a second due to unknown etiology in the patient managed non-surgically. No peripheral vascular or aortic graft related complications have occurred. The treatment of AAA and RCA should be governed by the size of the AAA, the location of the cancer, and the extent of malignant disease. Simultaneous resection is safe and effective in patients with coexistent AAA and renal cancer. Left sided tumors should be resected via a retroperitoneal approach that also provides excellent exposure for simultaneous AAA resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Vorozole (5 and 2.5 mg/kg body wt) and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (15 and 6 mg/rat) were administered daily (by gavage) to virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats starting at an age of 43 days. Seven days later animals were given a single dose of MNU. Following treatment with MNU, animals continued to be treated with vorozole and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione daily until the end of the experiment (100 days post MNU treatment). Vorozole at either dose proved to be a profound inhibitor of MNU-induced mammary tumors. Vorozole decreased tumor incidence from 100% to 10%, while simultaneously decreasing tumor multiplicity from 5 tumors per animal to 0.1 tumors per animal. This chemopreventive effect was accompanied by significant increases in body weight gain in the animals treated with vorozole when compared with control rats. In contrast, neither dose of 4-hydroxyandrostenedione had any effect on tumor incidence and only the higher dose slightly decreased tumor multiplicity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8035434	<TITLE>Clinical trials--a brave new partnership?</TITLE>The need for informed consent is considered from the patient's viewpoint by an examination of the shortcomings of the UK Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) trial and its failure satisfactorily to accrue both profession and patient. The impersonal, negative aspects of the informed consent process in the research situation are contrasted with the positive benefits of confidence fostered by the traditional doctor/patient relationship. The need for new research with a partnership between patient and profession, the necessity for rigorous re-assessment of treatments and care both within and outside of trials to avoid waste by the perpetration of unnecessary treatments together with the need for evaluation of the efficacy of treatments employed outside of trials, especially in 'new' conditions, to foster progress and maintain public confidence in the profession, is advocated.

8078513	<TITLE>Isolation and characterization of the gene encoding histone H2A from Trypanosoma cruzi.</TITLE>In the present paper we report the isolation and characterization of the sequence of two genomic DNA fragments coding for the histone H2A of Trypanosoma cruzi. An analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence shows the presence of the amino-terminal motif characteristic of the H2A histones proteins and the Lys-Lys motif reported to be the site for the ubiquitin attachment. Southern blots of total parasite DNA probed with the H2A sequence suggested that the T. cruzi histone H2A gene is encoded in two independent gene clusters. The molecular karyotyping of the parasite indicated that these two clusters locate in a single chromosome of about 700 kb in length. The T. cruzi H2A mRNA is polyadenylated as are the basal histone mRNAs of higher eukaryotes and the histone mRNAs of yeast. By polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing and by S1 mapping we determined respectively the 5' and 3' end of the gene showing that the miniexon is added to the mRNA 71 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon and that the polyadenylation site locates in nucleotide position 773-775 close to invert repeats.

8088825	<TITLE>Organization of the human zeta-crystallin/quinone reductase gene (CRYZ).</TITLE>zeta-Crystallin is a protein highly expressed in the lens of guinea pigs and camels, where it comprises about 10% of the total soluble protein. It has recently been characterized as a novel quinone oxidoreductase present in a variety of mammalian tissues. We report here the isolation and characterization of the human zeta-crystallin gene (CRYZ) and its processed pseudogene. The functional gene is composed of nine exons and spans about 20 kb. The 5'-flanking region of the gene is rich in G and C (58%) and lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Previous analysis of the guinea pig gene revealed the presence of two different promoters, one responsible for the high lens-specific expression and the other for expression at the enzymatic level in numerous tissues. Comparative analysis with the guinea pig gene shows that a region of approximately 2.5 kb that includes the promoter responsible for the high expression in the lens in guinea pig is not present in the human gene.

Fifty-four percent (92 patients) had limited joint mobility (LJM) of the hand, a prevalence significantly higher than that of non-diabetic controls (7%). Duration of diabetes was positively related to the severity of LJM (p = 0.03, chi-square contingency table). Chronic diabetic complications such as cataracts (p = 0.04) and overt proteinuria (p = 0.03) were also associated with the presence of LJM, and diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.007); vision-threatening retinopathy was strongly associated with the presence of LJM (p = 0.0002). The sex ratio, HbA1c and creatinine clearance rates did not show significant differences between patients with and without LJM. In conclusion, the occurrence of LJM of the hand in NIDDM patients observed at this hospital is common and is often accompanied by other chronic diabetic complications. Its presence should alert physicians to other associated diabetic complications with increased morbidity and mortality.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8186989	<TITLE>Appearance of calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the upper layers of the rat superior colliculus after eye enucleation.</TITLE>The effects of retinal deafferentation on a calcium-binding protein, calretinin, in the upper layers (superficial gray layer and optic nerve layer) of the rat superior colliculus were examined. In intact rats and on the ipsilateral side of unilaterally eye-enucleated rats, the superficial gray layer and optic nerve layer contained a few dispersed calretinin-immunoreactive cells. On the contralateral side to the enucleation, the number of immunostained cells in the superficial gray layer and optic nerve layer was increased. These findings suggest that retinal deafferentation results in an increase in contents of calretinin in some cell bodies within the upper layers of the superior colliculus.

8242632	<TITLE>Mutagenicity induced by hyperthermia, hot mate infusion, and hot caffeine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</TITLE>Mate, an infusion containing caffeine (3 g/liter), is drunk hot by most Uruguayan, North Argentinian, and South Brazilian people. This beverage has been recently associated with esophageal cancer in Brazil and Uruguay. To test the mutagenic and lethal effects of mate infusion, caffeine, hyperthermia, and their combinations, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an eucaryotic model system measuring lys to LYS reversions. We showed that mate infusion was not mutagenic, whereas caffeine at the same concentration contained in mate, produced a 5-fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate. The highest observed mutagenic rate corresponded to hyperthermia (54 degrees C at 60 min). Hot caffeine also produced a time-dependent mutagenic effect, whereas hot mate infusion determined a significantly lower mutagenic effect than hot caffeine. The differential lethality produced by the tested agents plays an important role in the expression of the induced mutagenic damage. Caffeine and mate infusion could decrease the mutagenic effect of hyperthermia through the channeling of part of the induced DNA lesions into an error-free repair pathway.

We found elevated DNA elution rates, which must be interpreted as an increased strand breakage frequency. There were significant correlations between the DNA strand breakage frequency and smoking habits. Using the 32P-postlabelling assay we determined the DNA adduct level in lymphocytes of 23 oral cancer patients (and two control groups). No significant influence of smoking habit on the DNA adduct level could be detected. There was a significant correlation between the DNA adduct level and the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) value, suggesting systemic influences of alcohol drinking habits on the adduct level.

However, information about the ability to detect stenotic lesions is lacking. The aim of our study was to determine the accuracy of Duplex scanning in detecting angiographically proven lesions. Twenty normal volunteers (13 males and seven females) and 24 patients (19 males and five females) with visceral artery stenosis on angiography were examined in the supine position (angle of insonation 60.5) with colour flow Duplex imaging (CFDI) (3.5 MHz probe), in the fasting state and after a standard meal at 15, 40, 60 and 90 min. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were determined in both CA and SMA. The PSV was the best indicator of stenosis. After the meal, there was an increase in both PSV and EDV but neither of the postprandial measurements improved the accuracy of the test. The results indicate that CFDI can detect the presence of significant stenosis (> 50% in the CA and SMA with a sensitivity and specificity of > 80%.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8276523	<TITLE>Successful gonadotrophin treatment of hypogonadism in postoperative patients with macroprolactinoma and persistent hyperprolactinaemia.</TITLE>We report on two males with prolactinoma in whom hyperprolactinaemia and hypogonadism persisted for several years postoperatively despite the administration of a dopamine agonist or bromocriptine. In these patients, a GnRH test revealed no response in the levels of serum LH or FSH. An hCG stimulation test provoked no response in the serum levels of testosterone. Case 1, who was 28 years old at the first visit, received parenteral testosterone and appreciable virilization of the genitalia was noted within a few months. When he married and desired to father a child, the treatment was switched to hCG/hMG combined therapy and spermatozoa appeared subsequently in the ejaculate, although their numbers were low. His wife conceived and delivered a healthy baby girl. Case 2 was a single young man who presented with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and hyperprolactinaemia. He was started on hCG injections three times per week and the maturation of his genitalia was advanced rapidly. Semen analyses showed sperm concentration and motility to be within the normal range. Post-treatment GnRH test revealed no improvement in gonadotrophin responses for LH or FSH. In both cases, the hCG test repeated after the gonadotrophin treatment showed normal basal and stimulated testosterone levels. During the course of gonadotrophin treatment in these cases, serum prolactin levels remained elevated, and it is suggested that, in the two cases, the hypothalamo-pituitary function was disturbed by the tumour or its manipulation and the capacity of the pituitary gland to secrete gonadotrophin was impaired. Under such circumstances with persisting hyperprolactinaemia, hCG and/or hCG/hMG combination treatment can induce normal virilization and advance spermatogenesis sufficiently to achieve fertility.

8292014	<TITLE>The 100-kDa protein, whose phosphorylation precedes the fusion of chick embryonic myoblasts, is the eukaryotic elongation factor-2.</TITLE>We have previously shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein dramatically increases during the early period of myoblast fusion and inhibition of the protein phosphorylation prevents the fusion. Here, we show that the protein phosphorylation occurs exclusively at Thr residue(s) and the purified 100-kDa protein can be ADP-ribosylated upon treatment with diphtheria toxin. Furthermore, the 13 N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 100-kDa protein, N-Val-Asn-Phe-Val-Asp-Gln-Ile-Arg-Ala-Ile-Met-Asp-Lys, exactly matches with that of elongation factor-2 from rat and hamster. These results indicate that the 100-kDa protein in chick embryonic myoblasts is identical to the eukaryotic elongation factor-2.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Their structures were established on the basis of chemical reactions and spectral analysis. The structural elucidation indicated that the structures of some related compounds should be revised. The isolated sesquiterpenes were observed to inhibit Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation significantly at low doses.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8367852	<TITLE>Permanent epicardial and transvenous single- and dual-chamber cardiac pacing in children.</TITLE>Between January 1974 and November 1991 33 children received a permanent single- or dual-chamber pacing system, mainly because of postoperative high-degree AV block. The children were followed up retrospectively for pacemaker- and lead-related complications, and for differences between epi- and endocardial stimulation. The overall rate of lead related complications was 35% and did not differ significantly between the epi- and endocardially paced groups, although it tended to be somewhat higher in the epicardially paced children, mainly due to a higher rate of exit blocks in the latter. The epicardially stimulated patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of pacemaker-related complications, which was primarily accounted for by a higher frequency of battery depletions in the epicardial systems. The most impressive differences between both groups, however, was seen with respect to subacute and chronic energy consumption. Chronic energy drain in the epicardially paced patients amounted to almost the sixfold of that seen in the endocardially stimulated children. This resulted in a significantly shorter cumulative pacemaker survival in the epicardial group. Therefore, it is concluded that, whenever possible, the transvenous approach be used in children and small infants too. However, as a rule, in the latter transvenous dualchamber pacing is usually not feasible. In these cases rate-adaptive single-chamber pacing has evolved as a reasonable alternative for improving hemodynamics as well as quality of life. In epicardial pacing the use of pulse generators allowing bidirectional telemetry is advisable. In this way monitoring of lead impedance and battery status can be performed noninvasively, thus permitting individualization of pulse widths and amplitude setting, which is important with respect to energy conservation.

8396459	<TITLE>Fast lidocaine block of cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium channels: one site with two routes of access.</TITLE>We have studied the block by lidocaine and its quaternary derivative, QX-314, of single, batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Lidocaine and QX-314, applied to the intracellular side, appear to induce incompletely resolved, rapid transitions between the open and the blocked state of BTX-activated sodium channels from both heart and skeletal muscle. We used amplitude distribution analysis (Yellen, G. 1984. J. Gen. Physiol. 84:157-186.) to estimate the rate constants for block and unblock. Block by lidocaine and QX-314 from the cytoplasmic side exhibits rate constants with similar voltage dependence. The blocking rate increases with depolarization, and the unblocking rate increases with hyperpolarization. Fast lidocaine block was virtually identical for sodium channels from skeletal (rat, sheep) and cardiac (beef, sheep) muscle. Lidocaine block from the extracellular side occurred at similar concentrations. However, for externally applied lidocaine, the blocking rate was voltage-independent, and was proportional to concentration of the uncharged, rather than the charged, form of the drug. In contrast, unblocking rates for internally and externally applied lidocaine were identical in magnitude and voltage dependence. Our kinetic data suggest that lidocaine, coming from the acqueous phase on the cytoplasmic side in the charged form, associates and dissociates freely with the fast block effector site, whereas external lidocaine, in the uncharged form, approaches the same site via a direct, hydrophobic path.

8416938	<TITLE>Studies of the DNA binding properties of histone H4 amino terminus. Thermal denaturation studies reveal that acetylation markedly reduces the binding constant of the H4 "tail" to DNA.</TITLE>The effect of acetylation on the DNA binding properties of the rigidly conserved histone H4 amino-terminal tail has been studied in detail using the technique of thermal denaturation. The quantitative DNA-binding parameters for both the non- and fully acetylated H4 amino terminus have been determined from thermal denaturation data for complexes of the peptides bound to mixed sequence 146-base pair DNA. We find that under dilute buffer conditions (5 mM Tris-HCl) the binding constant for the non-acetylated peptide to double-stranded DNA is 5 x 10(11) M-1 and that acetylation of lysine residues in the peptide reduces the binding constant to 1 x 10(5) M-1. The dramatic differences observed in the binding constants for the non- and fully acetylated peptides are probably due to the effect of acetylation on the even distribution of positively charged residues in the H4 amino terminus. In other experiments, the binding of both peptides to a 30-base pair oligonucleotide has been studied in solution with varying concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and phosphate ions. These experiments demonstrate that both magnesium and phosphate ions have strong effects on the binding of the H4 tail to DNA, especially weakening the binding of the acetylated peptide. For instance, the dissociation of the non-acetylated peptide from DNA requires 6 mM magnesium, yet the binding of the acetylated peptide is abolished in only 30 microM magnesium. The modulation of the DNA binding interactions of the H4 amino terminus by physiologically relevant ionic conditions, in addition to the effect of acetylation, can be important in the regulation of chromatin structure and function.

Four subsegmental portal branches were obstructed by PTT in three patients, and two were obstructed in the remaining six patients. TAE was performed into the targeted segmental hepatic artery followed by embolization with gelatin sponge particles.|In one patient undergoing subsequent resection, a marked anticancer effect on the PTT was demonstrated histologically. In the eight other patients who did not undergo subsequent resection, the cumulative survival rates were 67% at 6 months, 44% at 1 year, and 22% at 2 years. No serious complications were noted.|This therapeutic approach is thought to be a useful treatment for HCC with PTT, because it reinforces anticancer effects and can be performed more safely than conventional transcatheter arterial embolization.

8616830	<TITLE>Changes in insulin-like growth factor-I receptor expression and binding protein secretion associated with tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence in human breast cancer cells in vitro.</TITLE>Conditioned medium from a series of human breast cancer cell lines representing the phenotypes of estrogen dependence ZR-75-1, MCF-7), tamoxifen resistance (Z(+)-75-9a1, LY2) and estrogen independence (ZR-PR-Lt) contained four detectable insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) of MW 24, 34, 44 and 70 kDa. in the tamoxifen resistant lines secretion of the 24 kDA IGFBP was depressed in comparison to the parent lines whilst secretion of the 44 kDa IGFBP was unaffected. Secretion of this species by ZR-PR-LT cells was reduced. Following incubation in medium containing 1% serum both tamoxifen resistant cell lines secreted higher levels of the 44 kDa IGFBP than the respective parent lines. These changes in IGFBP secretion associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence were accompanied by changes in the expression of receptors for IGF-1.

8642052	<TITLE>Growth allometry of the mandibles of giant transgenic mice: an analysis based on the finite-element scaling method.</TITLE>Transgenic mice genetically engineered to produce increased levels of growth hormones, accelerated somatic growth, and larger terminal sizes [Palmiter et al., 1982, 1983] offer an intriguing model with which to investigate the genetic and developmental control of skeletal proportions. In this study, form differences in the mandible between giant transgenic mice (MT-rGH) and their normal litter-mate controls are examined using data generated by finite-element scaling analysis (FESA). Finite-element scaling analysis is a tensor based method developed to study morphological differences between forms. The method uses landmark data to provide measures of size and shape differences local to those landmarks of mandibular size and shape differences for 18 landmarks were compared between the two mouse samples. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were completed to ascertain 1) whether the mandible of larger transgenic mice differed significantly from normal controls, and 2) if observed proportion change resulted from the general allometric affects of overall mandibular size increase. Comparisons of local size and shape differences against a measure of total size difference reveal similar trajectories of growth allometry, indicating that proportion differences between adult control and transgenic mice result from ontogenic scaling.

8666081	<TITLE>Investigation of tick-borne viruses as pathogens of humans in South Africa and evidence of Dugbe virus infection in a patient with prolonged thrombocytopenia.</TITLE>In the course of investigating suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents. Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905/2116 (42.8%) for CCHF virus, 70/1358 (5.2%) for Dugbe, 21/1358 (1.5%) for louping ill, 6/450 (1.3%) for West Nile, 7/1358 (0.5%) for Nairobi sheep disease, 3/625 (0.5%) for Kadam and 2/450 (0.4%) for Chenuda. No reactions were recorded with Hazara, Bahig, Bhanja, Thogoto and Dhori viruses. The CCHF findings confirmed previous observations that the virus is widely prevalent within the distribution range of ticks of the genus Hyalomma, while antibody activity to Dugbe antigen was detected only within the distribution range of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum. Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, Nairobi sheep disease and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3/72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1/162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen. The latter patient suffered from febrile illness with prolonged thrombocytopenia.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

These include biological sciences, social sciences, behavioural sciences, other support subjects and clinical units. These different strands each, to some extent, present the nursing student with a dilemma as they may present entirely different models of the body. Explorations of this dilemma show that students are also being presented with different models of illness and different conceptions of appropriate health care response to illness. The question is then raised as to which of these approaches most accurately reflects the realities of nursing practice.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8787869	<TITLE>Ciprofloxacin absorption is impaired in patients given enteral feedings orally and via gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes.</TITLE>Twenty-six hospitalized patients participated in a randomized crossover study to evaluate the effect of enteral feedings on ciprofloxacin absorption when given orally or via gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes. Patients in the oral group received an intact 500-mg ciprofloxacin tablet alone or ciprofloxacin plus three oral doses of Sustacal (240 ml given 8 h before, with, and 4 h after ciprofloxacin administration). Patients with gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes received 500 mg of crushed ciprofloxacin in 60 ml water via the feeding tube. After a washout period, the patients received ciprofloxacin with a continuous enteral formula (Jevity) given at 60 to 90 ml/h beginning 6 h before drug administration and continuing for 10 h. Serial blood samples were analyzed for ciprofloxacin concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography. The maximum ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum for ciprofloxacin given and for ciprofloxacin plus enteral feeding for the oral, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy groups were (mean +/- standard deviation) 2.59 +/- 1.24 versus 1.43 +/- 0.61 micrograms/ml (P < 0.05), 3.68 +/- 1.36 versus 2.27 +/- 0.67 micrograms/ml (P < 0.05), and 3.78 +/- 1.87 versus 1.45 +/- 0.48 micrograms/ml (P < 0.05), respectively. Corresponding values for area under the concentration-time curve were 13.4 +/- 8.32 versus 9.44 +/- 4.74 micrograms/h/ml (P < 0.05) 15.9 +/- 6.62 versus 7.44 +/- 3.16 (micrograms/h/ml (P < 0.05), and 18.1 +/- 9.37 versus 5.82 +/- 2.63 micrograms.h/ml (P < 0.05). We conclude that enteral feedings given orally or via gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes resulted in a 27 to 67% reduction in the mean bioavailability of ciprofloxacin in hospitalized patients. The decreased absorption may be clinically important, especially when the enteral feeding is coadministered with ciprofloxacin by the oral and jejunostomy tube routes. Reductions in maximum levels of ciprofloxacin in serum as a result of feedings given via a gastrostomy tube are similar to those following oral administration on an empty stomach, making a clinically important interaction by this route less likely.

8790338	<TITLE>Chromatin structure and gene expression.</TITLE>It is now well understood that chromatin structure is perturbed in the neighborhood of expressed genes. This is most obvious in the neighborhood of promoters and enhancers, where hypersensitivity to nucleases marks sites that no longer carry canonical nucleosomes, and to which transcription factors bind. To study the relationship between transcription factor binding and the generation of these hypersensitive regions, we mutated individual cis-acting regulatory elements within the enhancer that lies between the chicken beta- and epsilon-globin genes. Constructions carrying the mutant enhancer were introduced by stable transformation into an avian erythroid cell line. We observed that weakening the enhancer resulted in creation of two classes of site: those still completely accessible to nuclease attack and those that were completely blocked. This all-or-none behavior suggests a mechanism by which chromatin structure can act to sharpen the response of developmental systems to changing concentrations of regulatory factors. Another problem raised by chromatin structure concerns the establishment of boundaries between active and inactive chromatin domains. We have identified a DNA element at the 5' end of the chicken beta-globin locus, near such a boundary, that has the properties of an insulator; in test constructions, it blocks the action of an enhancer on a promoter when it is placed between them. We describe the properties and partial dissection of this sequence. A third problem is posed by the continued presence of nucleosomes on transcribed genes, which might prevent the passage of RNA polymerase. We show, however, that a prokaryotic polymerase can transcribe through a histone octamer on a simple chromatin template. The analysis of this process reveals that an octamer is capable of transferring from a position in front of the polymerase to one behind, without ever losing its attachment to the DNA.

8803641	<TITLE>The effects of nimodipine on ischemic injury of the spinal cord during thoracic aortic cross-clamping.</TITLE>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of a neuroselective calcium antagonist, nimodipine on spinal cord ischemia during and after thoracic aortic cross-clamping.|Thirty adult dogs underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping via a left thoracotomy. The dogs were randomized into 3 groups (n = 10) and received either intravenous control (normal saline), sham (polyethylene glycol) or nimodipine solution during a period of 150 minutes. Spinal cord perfusion (SCP) was directly monitored using a laser doppler flowmeter. After 48 hours, neurologic status was assessed using Tarlov scores and the spinal cords evaluated histologically for evidence of ischemia (grades 1-4: severe to mild ischemia).|Twenty-six dogs survived the operation. Proximal (carotid) blood pressure increased 30-40% and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure increased 50% during cross-clamping for all 3 groups. The SCP decreased predictably during cross-clamping in all dogs but after unclamping, the nimodipine group had significantly less hyperperfusion than the saline and sham control groups (30 min after unclamping, control: 74.1 +/- 12.6 ml/min, sham: 51.8 +/- 4.15 ml/min, nimodipine: 33.1 +/- 3.9 ml/min, p = 0.04). This hyperperfusion phenomenon correlated with adverse neurologic (Tarlov score) outcome (p = 0.01). Paraplegia rates were 78% (control), 70% (sham) and 71% (nimodipine) (p = NS). The histologic grades of the spinal cords from those dogs which received nimodipine tended to correspond to better tissue preservation (control: 1.72 +/- 0.49, sham: 1.75 +/- 0.46, nimodipine: 2.14 +/- 0.56, p = NS).|Nimodipine used as single agent therapy failed to show a statistically significant clinical neurologic benefit. However, nimodipine significantly decreased postischemic reperfusion hyperemia in the spinal cord as measured by laser doppler flowmetry. This reduced hyperperfusion, which significantly correlated with functional outcome, may be responsible for dampening neural cell damage. Thus, nimodipine should be considered as an adjunct to a multimodality approach in the prevention of spinal cord ischemia during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions.

8918684	<TITLE>The use of saliva cortisol, urinary cortisol, and catecholamine measurements for a noninvasive assessment of stress responses in dogs.</TITLE>A problem in assessing animal welfare is that collecting data in itself may be stressful to the animals. Therefore, noninvasive methods for collecting data have to be devised and tested. A first step in investigating saliva cortisol, urinary cortisol, and urinary catecholamine as noninvasive indicators of canine well-being is the validation of these hormonal measures as alternatives for those in plasma. Using a model of insulin (0.2 U/kg)-induced hypoglycemia, we report on stress-induced responses in saliva cortisol, urinary cortisol, and urinary catacholamines relative to cortisol and catecholamine responses in plasma. Hypoglycemia in six dogs induced significant (P < 0.05) increases in plasma cortisol and adrenaline but not noradrenaline. Saliva cortisol responses expressed as net area under the response curve correlated significantly with plasma cortisol responses (r > 0.92). Saliva cortisol levels measured 7 to 12% of plasma cortisol concentrations. Cortisol/creatinine rations in urine were significantly higher when voided after insulin administeration, compared to when voided after saline treatment. Insulin-induced increments in cortisol/ creatinine ratios were nonsignificant when urine samples were assayed after dichloromethane extraction. Although urinary adrenaline/creatinine (A/C) ratios were significantly correlated with maximum plasma adrenaline values after insulin administration, A/C ratios did not differ significantly between insulin and saline treatment. The present experiment provides strong support for using saliva sampling and urine collection as noninvasive methods to establish stress-induced cortisol responses. For measuring acute plasma adrenaline responses, measuring A/C ratios may not be a valid alternative.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
8954572	<TITLE>Identification of multiple rabbit flavin-containing monooxygenase form 1 (FMO1) gene promoters and observation of tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites.</TITLE>We have cloned and partially characterized the rabbit FMO1 gene as a first approach to understanding mechanisms controlling its tissue-specific expression. The isolated clones contain 14 kb of 5' flanking information and approximately 30 kb of the structural gene, but do not include the 3'-end. Two upstream exons were defined, both encoding 5' leader information. The first exon, termed exon 0, contains information not previously reported. The second exon, termed exon 1, contains information previously reported for the rabbit FMO1 cDNA. Protein coding information begins seven nucleotides from the start of exon 2. A single transcription start site was localized in exon 1, while a cluster of sites were defined in exon 0, consistent with two alternative promoters. Transcripts initiating in exon 0 do not contain exon 1 information due to alternative processing and represent the major FMO1 mRNA. Neither promoter contains a TATA box or GC islands, although the exon 1 promoter does share some sequence identity with initiator-type elements. Homologous sequences to several known transcription factor binding sites were found in the upstream region of the FMO1 promoters. Both promoters were active in directing luciferase expression when transiently transfected into human HepG2 cells, although the data are consistent with both requiring upstream enhancer sequences. Consistent with this observation, DNase I hypersensitive sites were mapped to a 600-bp region immediately upstream of exon 0 using liver nuclei. No such sites were detected with nuclei from lung. Differential DNA methylation also was not observed between these two tissues.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Each patient underwent three Mini-Mental Status Examinations (MMSE) and the medical record was reviewed for pertinent past medical history, laboratory data, and evidence of delirium on three occasions: one day preoperatively (before H-2 blocker was given), in the early postoperative period (while receiving the H-2 blocker); usually two days postoperatively on the day of hospital discharge (several days after the H2 blocker had been discontinued).|Overall, both groups in the early postoperative period showed a significant decrease in the MMSE score (27.11 +/- 4.44 to 25.38 +/-2.87, mean +/- SD; t = 5.16, p < .0005), which resolved by the time of hospital discharge. There was no significant difference between cimetidine and ranitidine. Both age and preoperative MMSE score were strongly associated with the development of delirium.|We found no significant difference between cimetidine's versus ranitidine's effect upon cognitive functioning in the postoperative cardiac surgical patient.

9007352	<TITLE>Variations in restorative treatment decisions: an international comparison.</TITLE>Variations between dentists in treatment thresholds and diagnostic decisions based on radiographs have not been fully explained. Since variations have been shown to exist between as well as within countries, it is possible that the structure of incentives inherent in different health care systems, and cultural influences on health and health care may play a part. This paper compares the results of a study undertaken in Scotland with a replication study undertaken in Canada concerning dentists' restorative thresholds and treatment decisions based on radiographic evidence. The Canadian dentists operated with greater sensitivity but lower specificity than their Scottish counterparts, although ROC analysis indicated similar overall abilities to detect carious lesions. The dentists' action thresholds also differed. However, methodological issues mean that the data from the study need to be interpreted with caution.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Twenty patients were male and 3 were female with an age range of 43 to 86 years (mean age, 68.8 years). Twenty-one cases were pure SCNEC and 2 were high grade undifferentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. There were no false-positive or false-negative urine cytology diagnoses, but several cases of SCNEC were originally diagnosed as high grade transitional cell carcinoma by cytology.|Cytologic features of SCNEC included hypercellularity with isolated single cells and clustered cells with naked hyperchromatic nuclei, finely granular nuclear chromatin, rare nucleoli, and a high mitotic karyorrhectic index. Nuclear molding was prominent. No glandular formation or nesting was noted. Half of the cases had a bloody, necrotic, or inflamed background. Histology, when available, was confirmatory in all cases.|Cytologic features of SCNEC are distinct and an accurate urinary cytologic diagnosis can be made. Differential diagnosis is limited and includes metastatic small cell carcinoma, high grade transitional cell carcinoma, and malignant lymphoma.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9031810	<TITLE>Predicting long-term glycemic control of post-educational type II diabetic patients by evaluating serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels.</TITLE>1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1.5-AG) is known to closely reflect diabetic control within several days. The possibility of predicting long-term glycemic control after an educational hospitalization of type II diabetic patients was investigated by examining the relationship between changes in serum 1,5-AG levels after a short-term trial home stay following an educational program and long-term changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after discharge. After 22 patients with type II diabetes had successfully completed the educational hospitalization program, they returned as outpatients for 5 nights in a row. Changes in serum 1,5-AG levels were determined during this period. The HbA1c levels were then determined over a period of 3 months after discharge, and the relationship between changes in 1,5-AG and HbA1c levels was examined. Changes in serum 1,5-AG levels during the 5-day trial home stay and the changes in HbA1c levels during the 3 months after discharge from the hospital were found to be significantly correlated (r = 0.70, P < 0.01). A comparison of the decreased group, which exhibited a decrease in 1.5-AG levels of 5.0 mumol/l or more during the trial home stay, and the unchanged group, revealed that increases in body mass index 3 months after discharge were significantly higher in the decreased group (1.2 +/- 0.4%) than in the unchanged group (0.2 +/- 0.5%) (P < 0.05). Determination of serum 1,5-AG levels of patients with type II diabetes before and after a trial home stay following educational hospitalization was found to be useful in identifying patients at high risk of recurrence of poor glycemic control in the future.

9109550	<TITLE>Enhancement of apoptosis in developing chick neural retina cells by basic fibroblast growth factor.</TITLE>To evaluate the role of various growth factors in naturally occurring cell death during development of the neural retina, we examined the effects of such factors on the nuclear morphology and the size of DNA in cultured chick embryonic neural retina cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased internucleosomal cleavage of DNA and nuclear fragmentation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The effect was inhibited by anti-bFGF antibody, suramin, and cycloheximide. Epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and dexamethasone had no effect. These results provide evidence that bFGF may eventually act as a lethal factor inducing apoptotic cell death during the development of the neural retina in chick embryo.

9229384	<TITLE>Neutralization of bovine concanavalin-A T cell supernatant-mediated anti-Cowdria ruminantium activity with antibodies specific to interferon gamma but not to tumor necrosis factor.</TITLE>In an earlier study we demonstrated that Concanavalin-A stimulated bovine T cell supernatants inhibited the growth of Cowdria ruminantium in bovine endothelial cells in vitro. An investigation was conducted to identify the cytokines which were responsible for this growth inhibition. Addition of antiserum against bovine interferon gamma (IFN gamma) reproducibly neutralized the inhibitory effect of the T cell supernatants, whereas addition of antisera against bovine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) had no effect. The inhibitory effect of IFN gamma on C. ruminantium growth was not mediated by the production of nitric oxide as there was no detectable difference in nitric oxide levels in cultures that were supplemented with T cell supernatants compared with those that were not. The IFN gamma mediated anti-C. ruminantium effect highlights the importance of cell mediated immune responses in control of these infections and in particular incriminates the protective role of T cells, or cells that secrete IFN gamma.

Difficulties in identifying appropriate lay people to involve in research, their different skills, their lack of resources and support and their need for time for thought and discussion with their peers have all posed problems. Suggestions for overcoming some of these obstacles are presented, including resources, training and support, and clarification of the role, nature and potential for lay involvement. Lastly this paper considers the urgent need to learn from the efforts made so far, possible approaches to evaluation and how this is being addressed by a newly convened advisory group to the Central R&D Committee.

9313608	<TITLE>Short- and long-term outcome of narrowed saphenous vein bypass graft: a comparison of Palmaz-Schatz stent, directional coronary atherectomy, and balloon angioplasty.</TITLE>Percutaneous treatment of saphenous vein graft (SVG) stenosis has been established as an alternative to repeat coronary artery bypass grafting. Intracoronary Palmaz-Schatz stent (PSS) and directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) have been suggested to provide better short- and long-term results than balloon angioplasty. Records of 840 patients with 931 SVG lesions treated with PSS (121 patients, 132 lesions), DCA (103 patients, 107 lesions), and balloon angioplasty (616 patients, 692 lesions) were reviewed. Inhospital and long-term outcome were compared among treated groups. The groups had similar clinical and angiographic baseline characteristics except for higher previously dilated grafts in the stent group and graft location among devices. Stent placement was angiographically successful in 99%, DCA in 95%, and balloon angioplasty in 93% of the lesions (p = 0.03). Quantitative angiography revealed a larger lumen diameter after procedure after PSS (3.2 mm) and DCA (3.1 mm) compared with 2.4 mm after balloon angioplasty (p = 0.0001). Angiographic complications (abrupt closure, severe dissections, or distal embolization) were evident in eight (6.1%) lesions after PSS placement, in 17 (15.9%) after DCA, and in 61 (8.8%) after balloon angioplasty. Serious in-hospital clinical complications (death, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, or Q-wave myocardial infarction) were similar among devices. Survival rates were similar among the groups (p = 0.15). Repeat revascularization at follow-up was reported in 58 (60.4%) of patients after PSS, in 48 (51.1%) after DCA, and in 280 (49.4%) after balloon angioplasty. Correlates of additional revascularization at follow-up were older grafts, calcific lesions, previously dilated grafts, longer lesions, and patients with lower ejection fractions (odds ratio 1.06, 1.34, 1.43, 1.04, and 1.01, respectively). Correlates of mortality rate at follow-up were older patients, patients with lower ejection fractions, and distal embolization (odds ratio 1.04, 1.04, and 1.92, respectively). These data suggest that in patents with SVG stenosis the initial success and morbidity rates are similar when comparing PSS and DCA with balloon angioplasty. Although a larger lumen is obtained with PSS and DCA, patients who underwent balloon angioplasty had similar rates of cardiac events and requirements for additional procedures at follow-up.

9361427	<TITLE>Detection of low levels of enteric viruses in metropolitan and airplane sewage.</TITLE>To detect less prevalent viruses, such as wild-type polioviruses in sewage from a highly immunized community, a method was developed to efficiently recover viruses and remove PCR inhibitors. The method consisted of initial separation of solids from liquid, followed by solvent extractions, polyethylene glycol precipitations, Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and guanidinium isothiocyanate (GIT) extraction. To elute viruses from the separated solids, 0.5 M threonine (pH 7.5) was as efficient as 3% beef extract but conferred no PCR inhibition. In samples that were concentrated approximately 1,000-fold, 21% of the initially seeded viruses were recovered. When poliovirus type 3 (PV3) Sabin strain at low levels and PV1 LSc strain at high levels were seeded in raw sewage, PV3 was specifically detected in the final sample concentrates at sensitivities of 14 PFU by direct PCR and 0.7 PFU by GIT extraction-PCR. While applying the method to international airplane sewage, which contains high levels of solids as well as commercial sanitizers, 44% (7 of 16) of the samples were found to harbor enteroviruses by both cell culture infectivity and pan-enterovirus PCR analyses. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products revealed that multiple enterovirus genotypes were amplified from each final sewage concentrate, whereas the fewer virus genotypes detected by cell culture infectivity were probably the better growing strains. By this method, we demonstrated that air travel may contribute to the intercontinental dissemination of enteric pathogens.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9402967	<TITLE>Identification of an amplified gene cluster in glioma including two novel amplified genes isolated by exon trapping.</TITLE>Gene amplification, which occurs in more than 50% of malignant gliomas, is considered to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. There are, however, few studies aimed toward the isolation of novel genes from amplified sequences. Previously, we reported amplification of the protooncogene MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor; 7q31) in more than 20% of glioblastomas. For an approximate size estimation of the amplification unit we analyzed three glioblastomas all of which carried an amplified MET gene, by Southern blot analysis and/or competitive polymerase chain reaction using eight DNA markers. Although the extent of the amplified domain varied, the close vicinity of the MET gene was the only region consistently amplified in these glioblastomas. A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig of 900 kb was refined spanning the amplified region flanking the MET gene. The YAC inserts were subcloned into 59 cosmids, which were used for exon trapping. Eight sequences were identical to parts of the genes MET and CAPZA2 (human actin capping protein alpha-subunit). Two newly identified exons and the CAPZA2 exons were amplified in tumor TX3095, which retains an amplified MET gene. The new exons were localized close to MET and CAPZA2. Characterization of the clones, which were termed glioma-amplified sequence (GAS)7-1 and GAS7-2, showed an open reading frame and a different expression pattern in multiple human tissues. This study reports the identification of a cluster of amplified genes including two novel genes in a region amplified in more than 20% of glioblastomas.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9412728	<TITLE>Effect of peptide to carrier ratio on the immune and ovarian response to inhibin immunization in cattle.</TITLE>We report on the effects of the peptide to carrier ratio on the immune and biological response to inhibin immunization in cattle. A peptide sequence from the alpha C-subunit of bovine inhibin was synthesized and conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) at ratios of 4.3 moles (L) and 13.1 moles (M) of peptide per mole of HSA. Hereford-cross heifers (n = 6 per group) were injected with 3 mg of one of the peptide conjugates at primary, followed by a booster injection (1.5 mg) 11 weeks later. Control heifers (n = 6) were injected with HSA only. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals to measure antibody titre. Ovulation rate was measured by ultrasonography. Antibodies were generated in both peptide immunized groups. Control heifers and group L heifers had 1 ovulation at all ovulatory cycles monitored. Ovulation rate was increased (P < 0.05) in group M immunized heifers, with four of six heifers having twin ovulations in the first cycle following boost. These data support those of previous studies which indicated that immunization against the alpha C-subunit of bovine inhibin significantly disrupted the mechanism(s) controlling ovulation rate in cattle. It also indicates that both the immune and associated biological response is dependent on the nature of the conjugate used for immunization, specifically the ratio of peptide to carrier.

9413556	<TITLE>Purification of human alpha 2-antiplasmin with chicken IgY specific to its carboxy-terminal peptide.</TITLE>alpha 2-antiplasmin, a plasma glycoprotein of the serpin superfamily, is the primary physiological inhibitor of plasmin, the key enzyme in fibrin degradation. Previous purification methods utilize lengthy multistep protocols with low yields or use monoclonal antibodies that are expensive or difficult to make. With a relatively small investment, a chicken was immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated to alpha 2-antiplasmin C-terminal 26 residue synthetic peptide and the peptide-specific antibody (IgY) was isolated from the egg yolks of hens using the peptide affinity column. Based on the interaction between this IgY and alpha 2-antiplasmin, pure alpha 2-antiplasmin was isolated from human plasma in two steps: (a) citrated plasma was precipitated with 15% PEG-8000 to remove the bulk of plasma proteins while retaining the majority of alpha 2-antiplasmin activity; and (b) the alpha 2-antiplasmin was affinity-purified from the supernatant using the IgY column. Yields were typically 48% and the purity and authenticity of the alpha 2-antiplasmin were verified by gel electrophoresis, Western Blot analysis, N-terminal sequence, and amino acid analysis.

9443615	<TITLE>Diversity of metallothionein content and subcellular localization in the National Cancer Institute tumor panel.</TITLE>Metallothioneins (MTs) are major thiol-containing intracellular proteins that bind metals, are induced by stress, and have been implicated in resistance to drugs and heavy metals.|To examine the hypothesis that the protective functionality of MT may be dictated by its subcellular localization.|We analyzed the basal MT content in 53 adherent cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) tumor panel and quantified the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of MT using confocal laser scanning microscopy and a recently described immunofluorescence-based algorithm.|Among these cell types we found a 400-fold range in the basal MT levels and a tenfold range in the ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic MT immunostaining that was independent of basal MT content. Total MT levels and nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution were independent of total glutathione content, suggesting autonomous regulation of these protective protein and nonprotein thiol pools. Approximately 50% (29/53) of the cell lines had a greater nuclear than cytoplasmic MT density and were defined as having a karyophilic phenotype. Tissue specificity of MT localization was seen with breast cancer cell lines, which were cytoplasmophilic, whereas prostate-derived cells were karyophilic. Among the 25000 unrestricted compounds in the NCI database, we detected a correlation between total basal MT levels and resistance to CdCl2, four Pt- and two Cu-containing compounds. High nuclear/cytoplasmic MT values correlated with resistance to six Cu-, six Pb-, and one Zn-containing compounds.|These results demonstrated significant diversity in MT content and subcellular localization in human tumor cells. Moreover, both basal MT levels and subcellular distribution appeared to be determinants of cellular responsiveness to metal-containing compounds.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Baccetti et al. (1995, J. Androl., 16, 356-371). PVP had a primary detrimental action on the plasma membrane, as well as on acrosomal and mitochondrial membranes.

9535343	<TITLE>Hepatic metabolism of skatole in pigs by cytochrome P4502E1.</TITLE>High concentrations of skatole in fat are a major cause of boar taint in intact male pigs. Skatole is metabolized in the liver, and this metabolism could affect concentrations of skatole in fat. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of cytochrome P450, in particular cytochrome P4502E1, in skatole metabolism in pig liver. Liver microsomes from F4 European Wild Pig x Swedish Yorkshire intact male pigs were incubated in a buffer containing NADPH, NADH, and skatole. Several skatole metabolites were detected by HPLC, including 6-hydroxyskatole (pro-MII), 3-hydroxy-3-methyloxyindole (MIII), and five others not identified in this study. Inhibitors of P450 were added to microsomal incubations, and their effect on the formation of skatole metabolites and skatole disappearance was evaluated. The general cytochrome P450 inhibitors SKF 525A, at a concentration of .2 mM and metyrapone, at a concentration of .1 mM decreased the formation of pro-MII (P = .001) to 38.2 and 11.6%, respectively, of that of controls. The SKF 525A also reduced the synthesis of MIII and three other metabolites, whereas metyrapone only reduced the disappearance of skatole and synthesis of pro-MII. Inhibitors specific for cytochrome P4502E1 were more effective in reducing the formation of skatole metabolites than SKF 525A and metyrapone. Chlorzoxazone and diallyl sulfide reduced (P = .001) the synthesis of pro-MII to 9.7 and 30.9% of the control rate. The formation of most of the other skatole metabolites and disappearance of skatole were also reduced with these inhibitors. These results indicate that skatole is metabolized in pig liver to pro-MII and other metabolites by cytochrome P4502E1.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9535432	<TITLE>Endothelin-1 regulates tone of isolated small arteries in the rat: effect of hyperendothelinemia.</TITLE>Chronic elevation of plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels has been reported in several pathological conditions. To investigate the consequences of increased circulating ET-1 on vascular responsiveness, Sprague-Dawley rats (n=16) were chronically instrumented with a minipump delivering ET-1 at a constant dose for 7 days. Plasma ET-1 levels were more than doubled in treated (0.98+/-0.09 pmol/L; P<.05) versus untreated sham-operated rats (0.43+/-0.04 pmol/L), whereas systolic arterial blood pressure increased (139+/-5 versus 128+/-4 mm Hg in untreated rats; P<.05). After rats were killed, segments of middle cerebral (MCA) and mesenteric (MES) arteries were mounted on an isometric myograph. ET-induced contraction was shifted to the right in ET-1-treated animals and not modified by BQ123 (an ET(A) receptor antagonist); bosentan (ET(A/B) receptor antagonist) prevented ET-1-induced contraction in both groups. After inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), both phenylephrine and oxymetazoline (an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist) induced MCA contraction. The sensitivity to phenylephrine was decreased in ET-1-treated compared with control rats (P<.05). Sensitivity to phenylephrine-induced contraction was decreased by BQ123 in control rats only. In contrast, L-NNA revealed greater oxymetazoline-induced contractions in treated compared with control MCA rings (P<.05); this potentiation was blunted by bosentan but unaffected by BQ123. Removal of the endothelium revealed a direct constrictor effect of oxymetazoline that was insensitive to L-NNA alone or combined with bosentan; however, oxymetazoline induced significantly lower constriction in treated rat MCA segments. Responses to oxymetazoline were also blunted in treated compared with untreated denuded MES arteries. In conclusion, chronic elevated plasmatic ET-1 decreases smooth muscle cell sensitivity to contractile agonists both in MCA and MES rings. In cerebral vessels, endothelial alpha2-adrenoceptor-dependent stimulation induced greater contractile responses in treated rats which were sensitive to bosentan, suggesting that oxymetazoline stimulates ET-1 release from the endothelium. This may represent a compensatory mechanism for the loss of smooth muscle sensitivity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9541151	<TITLE>Low-dose clozapine in acute and continuation treatment of severe borderline personality disorder.</TITLE>Psychotic-like symptoms in patients affected by borderline personality disorder (BPD) are usually treated with low-dose neuroleptics, which show controversial acute effects and lead to a worsening of affective-related symptoms and to severe neurologic side effects after prolonged administration. Clozapine lacks the neurologic side effects of traditional neuroleptics and has been shown to successfully treat psychotic-like symptoms in BPD patients at medium dose. We performed an open-label trial of low-dose clozapine in severe BPD patients.|Twelve BPD inpatients (DSM-IV criteria) with severe psychotic-like symptoms were studied. Exclusion criteria included comorbid Axis I and medical pathologies. All patients had followed a therapeutic program without improvement for at least 4 months before admission. The clozapine dose was titrated upward on an individual basis until the complete disappearance of psychotic-like symptoms was achieved. Clinician-rated scales were completed at the beginning of the study and after 4 and 16 weeks.|All patients completed the 16-week study. Individual clozapine doses ranged from 25 to 100 mg/day. Psychotic-like symptoms decreased within the first 3 weeks of treatment, as confirmed by a statistically significant decrease in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. This amelioration was coupled with an overall improvement, including a reduction in impulsive behaviors and in affective-related symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and an increase in global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning).|Low-dose clozapine for acute and continuation treatment led to improvement in overall symptomatology in a small sample of severe BPD patients.

9549513	<TITLE>Cranial nerve syndrome in thrombosis of the transverse/sigmoid sinuses.</TITLE>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a cerebrovascular disease associated with a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms, which may often delay appropriate diagnosis. Single or multiple cranial nerve palsies (III-VIII) without evidence of other signs and symptoms have not, so far, been considered a relevant syndrome of CVT. This event turned out to be a characteristic finding in five patients with thrombosis of the ipsilateral transverse/sigmoid sinus, who were recruited prospectively over a 14-month period. The diagnosis was supported by non-invasive MRI with the application of a newly developed subtraction technique. In view of the considerable mimics of the syndrome, and the long-standing need for conventional angiography to confirm the disease, it is likely to have been underestimated in the past; since appropriate treatment seems possible the diagnosis and utility of early MR venography should be considered in patients with single or multiple cranial nerve lesions of uncertain aetiology.

9550877	<TITLE>Research update on serotonin function in bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.</TITLE>The extent to which dysregulation of serotonin function in the central nervous system may contribute to core symptoms in patients with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa is currently an area of intensive psychobiological investigation. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the involvement of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the regulation of food intake, suggesting that impaired serotonin-mediated satiety signals could contribute to patterns of recurrent binge eating. Other symptom patterns in patients with eating disorders, including mood dysregulation, impulsivity, and obsessionality, as well as therapeutic response to serotonergic agents, suggest involvement of serotonergic pathways. With a primary focus on serotonin function, this article reviews clinical studies of neuroendocrine and behavioral response to pharmacological challenges, levels of neurotransmitter metabolite in cerebrospinal fluid, and platelet studies. Controlled clinical trials involving pharmacological treatment with serotonergic medications are summarized. Considerations for future research are discussed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9631487	<TITLE>Slow-release pellets of sodium butyrate increase apoptosis in the colon of rats treated with azoxymethane, without affecting aberrant crypt foci and colonic proliferation.</TITLE>We investigated whether sodium butyrate, administered orally as gastroresistant slow-release pellets to rats, could affect markers of colon carcinogenesis. F344 male rats were fed a high-fat diet (230 g/kg corn oil, wt/wt) and treated with two injections (1 wk apart) of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg sc) or saline. Rats were then divided into two groups: one received the diet with 1.5% (wt/wt) sodium butyrate for 10 weeks to provide 150 mg butyrate/day, and one group received no butyrate. At the end of this period, rats were sacrificed, and colonic proliferative activity, number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and apoptosis were assessed in the colon. The proliferative activity and ACF induction were not affected by butyrate pellet administration. On the contrary, in rats treated with butyrate, apoptotic index increased from 0.12 +/- 0.12 to 0.81 +/- 0.10 (means +/- SE, p < 0.05). The short-chain fatty acid concentration was significantly increased in the feces of rats treated with butyrate. In conclusion, the increase in the mucosal apoptotic index suggests that gastroresistant butyrate pellets have a beneficial effect against colon carcinogenesis. However, because butyrate pellets did not modify proliferation or ACF induction, this conclusion should be confirmed in long-term carcinogenesis experiments.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9648276	<TITLE>Mice's brain radioprotection: comparative efficacy of a series of aminothiols and aminothiol precursors.</TITLE>A serie of radioprotective aminothiols was checked upon irradiation of the mice's brain. Cysteamine protects efficiently the brain as soon as 15 minutes after its administration. Among the tested aminothiols, it was the most effective compound. 2-isopropyl 1,3-thiazolane, rapidly hydrolysed, delivers a large amount of cysteamine in the brain and was nearly as potent as exogenous cysteamine. The other thiazolanes which delivered only progressively cysteamine or 2-mercaptopropylamine during a long period of time showed lesser efficacy. WR 2721 which did not penetrate the brain exhibited only a feeble radioprotection. The imperviousness to straight active aminothiols may be compensated by the diffusion of their precursors across the blood brain barrier and by their speed of hydrolysis, yielding active aminothiols during a short period of time between their administration and the irradiation.

9653874	<TITLE>Effects of S-8510, a novel benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist, on basal forebrain lesioning-induced dysfunction in rats.</TITLE>We investigated the effects of a novel benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, S-8510 (2-(3-isoxazolyl)-3,6,7,9-tetrahydroimidazo [4,5-d] pyrano [4,3-b] pyridine monophosphate monohydrate), on the impairment of spatial memory, decreased high-affinity choline uptake and acetylcholine release in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. S-8510 (3 and 5 mg/kg, p.o. 30 min before each training session) significantly ameliorated the basal forebrain-lesion-induced impairment of spatial memory in water maze task. In vivo brain microdialysis studies showed that systemic administration of S-8510 at 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly increased the release of acetylcholine in the front-parietal cortex in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. Further, repeated administration of S-8510 (3 and 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 5 days) reversed the decrease in cortical high-affinity choline uptake induced by basal forebrain lesion. Thus, S-8510 improved the spatial memory impairment induced by lesion of the basal forebrain in rats. In addition, it increased acetylcholine release and high-affinity choline uptake from the cortex, a region closely associated with memory, in basal forebrain-lesioned rats. These results indicate that S-8510 has cognition enhancing and cholinergic-activating effects in the basal forebrain-lesioned rats, suggesting that this agent may be useful for the treatment of mild to moderate senile dementia including Alzheimer's disease.

9765516	<TITLE>Detachment of cytochrome c by cationic drugs from membranes containing acidic phospholipids: comparison of lidocaine, propranolol, and gentamycin.</TITLE>A large number of pharmaceutically active compounds have a high affinity to acidic phospholipids; good examples are the cationic compounds lidocaine, propranolol, and gentamycin. These drugs influenced the lipid dynamics of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and the acidic phosphatidylglycerol, as judged by the excimer/monomer emission intensity ratio for a pyrene-labeled phospholipid analog, as well as by polarization of DPH fluorescence. When the mole fraction X of PG (XPG) was 0.20, lidocaine increased membrane fluidity. The opposite was true for propranolol, which caused the formation of pyrene lipid-enriched microdomains. Gentamycin had no apparent effect. At XPG = 1.00, all these drugs rigidified membrane. Subsequently, we investigated the detachment of a cationic peripheral membrane protein, cytochrome c (cyt c), by these compounds from liposomes. This was accomplished by monitoring resonance energy transfer from a pyrene-labeled phospholipid to the heme of cyt c. The efficiency of the above compounds to dissociate cyt c varied considerably. In brief, significantly lower concentrations of gentamycin than propranolol or lidocaine were required for half-maximal dissociation of cyt c from liposomes, although the final extent of protein detachment by gentamycin was less complete. ATP augmented the dissociation of cyt c from membranes by lidocaine and propranolol. Stopped-flow measurements also revealed that the half-times differed for the release of cyt c from the membranes. Our results are likely to reflect differences in the contributions of the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobicity to the drug/lipid interaction and comply with two different acidic phospholipid binding sites in cyt c.

9804382	<TITLE>Transgenic mice in the study of ALS: the role of neurofilaments.</TITLE>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurological disorder of multiple etiologies that affects primarily motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Abnormal accumulations of neurofilaments (NFs) in motor neurons and a down-regulation of mRNA for the NF light subunit (NF-L) are associated with ALS, but it remains unclear to what extent these NF perturbations contribute to human disease. Transgenic mouse studies demonstrated that overexpression of normal and mutant NF proteins can sometimes provoke a motor neuronopathy characterized by the presence of abnormal NF accumulations resembling those found in ALS. Remarkably, the motor neuronopathy in transgenic mice overexpressing human NF heavy (NF-H) subunits was rescued by the co-expression of a human NF-L transgene at levels that restored a correct stoichiometry of NF-L to NF-H subunits. Transgenic approaches have also been used to investigate the role of NFs in disease caused by Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutations, which is responsible for approximately 2% cases of ALS. Studies with transgenic mice expressing low levels of a fusion NF-H/lacZ protein, in which NFs are withheld from the axonal compartment, suggested that axonal NFs are not toxic intermediates required for SOD1-mediated disease. On the contrary, overexpression of human NF-H proteins was found to confer an effective protection against mutant SOD1 toxicity in transgenic mice, a phenomenon that may be due to the ability of NF proteins to chelate calcium. In conclusion, transgenic studies showed that disorganized NFs can sometimes have noxious effects resulting in neuronopathy. However, in the context of motor neuron disease caused by mutant SOD1, there is emerging evidence that NF proteins rather play a protective role.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Bone mineral density of the hip and spine was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.|A total of 77 Native American women aged 19 to 85 years.|Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D was related inversely to age (r = -0.32; P < .05) and was less than 15 ng/mL in 7% of the subjects. Serum osteocalcin was higher (P < .001) in postmenopausal than in premenopausal subjects. In postmenopausal subjects, serum osteocalcin was related to age (r = .59, P < .001). BMD was lower (P < .001) in postmenopausal than in premenopausal subjects. There was no evidence of bone loss before age 50 in either the femur or the spine. Age (r > or = -0.48, P < .001) and body mass index (BMI) (r > or = 0.41, P < .005) were independent determinants of both femoral and lumbar BMD. Serum 25OHD was a significant independent determinant of both lumbar (r = .26, P < .05) and femoral (r = .41, P < .01) BMD. Age, BMI, and serum 25OHD together accounted for 70% of the variance in BMD at these sites. The use of t scores indicated femoral bone density was higher (P < .05) in premenopausal Native American women, and lower (P < 0.05) in postmenopausal subjects, compared with white women.|In Native American women, there is a reduction in bone density and a sustained increase in bone turnover postmenopausally. BMI and serum 25OHD are significant determinants of BMD. Peak BMD may be higher, and the postmenopausal rate of bone loss greater, than that in white women.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
9841499	<TITLE>Renal microvascular actions of calcitonin gene-related peptide.</TITLE>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator that is suggested to act via ATP-sensitive K channels (KATP). In the present study, we examined the actions of CGRP on pressure- and angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, using the in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney. Elevated pressure (from 80 to 180 mmHg) and 0.1 nM angiotensin II elicited similar decreases in afferent diameter in this model. CGRP inhibited myogenic reactivity in a concentration-dependent manner, completely preventing pressure-induced constriction at 10 nM (95 +/- 10% inhibition). These effects were partially attenuated by 10 microM glibenclamide (62 +/- 16% inhibition, P = 0.025), indicating both KATP-dependent and -independent actions of CGRP. In contrast, 10 nM CGRP inhibited angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction by only 54 +/- 11%, and this action was not affected by glibenclamide (41 +/- 11%, P = 0.31). CGRP also inhibited the efferent arteriolar response to angiotensin II in the absence and presence of glibenclamide. Pinacidil (1.0 microM), a KATP opener also preferentially inhibited pressure- vs. angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction (97 +/- 5 and 59 +/- 13% inhibition, respectively; P = 0.034). We conclude that the renal vasodilatory mechanisms of CGRP are pleiotropic and involve both KATP-dependent and -independent pathways. The effectiveness of CGRP in opposing renal vasoconstriction and the role of KATP in this action appear to depend on the nature the underlying vasoconstriction. We suggest that this phenomenon reflects an inhibition of KATP activation by angiotensin II.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

9874703	<TITLE>Conformational stability of lyophilized PEGylated proteins in a phase-separating system.</TITLE>PEGylation of proteins is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry as covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules can increase protein sera half-lives and reduce antigenicity. Not surprisingly, PEGylation significantly alters the surface characteristics of a protein, and consequently, its conformational stability during freezing and drying. Freeze concentration-induced phase separation between excipients has been previously shown to cause degradation of the secondary structure in lyophilized hemoglobin. In this report we show how PEGylation of two proteins, hemoglobin- and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), influences partitioning and protein secondary structure as determined by FTIR spectroscopy in a system prone to freezing-induced phase separation. PEGylation of hemoglobin reduces the loss of structure induced by lyophilization in a PEG/dextran system that phase separates during freezing, perhaps due to altered partitioning. The partition coefficient for native hemoglobin favors the dextran-rich phase (PEG/dextran partition coefficient = 0.3), while PEGylated hemoglobin favors the PEG phase (partition coefficient = 3.1). In addition, we demonstrate that PEGylation alters hemoglobin's stability during lyophilization in the absence of other excipients. In contrast, because native BDNF already partitions into the PEG-rich phase, PEGylation of BDNF has a less dramatic effect on both partition coefficients and conformational stability during lyophilization. This is the first report on the effects of PEGylation on protein structural stability during lyophilization and points out the need to consider modification of formulations in response to changing protein surface characteristics.

9930600	<TITLE>The effect of dry heat on mite, cat, and dog allergens.</TITLE>Various techniques have been tried in an attempt to reduce allergen levels in homes. This study investigated the effect of dry heat on mite, cat, and dog allergens.|Samples (50 mg) of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae cultures, and of house dust rich in the major cat and dog allergens Fel d 1 and Can f 1 were heated for 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min at 60 degrees, 80 degrees, 100 degrees, 120 degrees, and 140 degrees C. Control samples remained at room temperature. Extracts were assayed with the appropriate two-site mono- or mono/polyclonal sandwich ELISA.|For Der p 1, the breakdown was proportional to temperature and heating time; after 30 min at 120 degrees C, allergen levels were reduced to < 1% of control. Der p 2 was more heat stable, requiring 140 degrees C for 30-60 min to achieve > 99% reduction. D. farinae groups 1 and 2 allergens showed results similar to those obtained with D. pteronyssinus. In contrast, Can f 1 and Fel d 1 were considerably more thermostable, with 50% and 70%, respectively, of allergen remaining after 60 min at 140 degrees C.|The effect of dry heat on allergens increased with increasing time and temperature, cat and dog allergens demonstrating greater heat resistance than mite allergens. Dry heating methods may represent an alternative technique for removal of mite allergens; however, the greater stability of Fel d 1 and Can f 1 suggests that this procedure may not be appropriate for pet allergens.

10024509	<TITLE>Differential regulation of the human nidogen gene promoter region by a novel cell-type-specific silencer element.</TITLE>Transfection analyses of the human nidogen promoter region in nidogen-producing fibroblasts from adult skin revealed multiple positive and negative cis-acting elements controlling nidogen gene expression. Characterization of the positive regulatory domains by gel mobility-shift assays and co-transfection studies in Drosophila SL2 cells unequivocally demonstrated that Sp1-like transcription factors are essential for a high expression of the human nidogen gene. Analysis of the negative regulatory domains identified a novel silencer element between nt -1333 and -1322, which is bound by a distinct nuclear factor, by using extracts from adult but not from embryonal fibroblasts. In embryonal fibroblasts, which express significantly higher amounts of nidogen mRNA as compared with adult fibroblasts, this inhibitory nidogen promoter region did not affect nidogen and SV40 promoter activities. The silencer element seems to be active only in nidogen-producing cells. Therefore this regulatory element might function in vivo to limit nidogen gene expression in response to external stimuli. However, none of the identified regulatory elements, including the silencer, contribute significantly to cell-specific expression of the human nidogen gene. Instead we provide evidence that gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes that are not producing nidogen is repressed by methylation-specific and chromatin-dependent mechanisms.

10229527	<TITLE>Segmental roentgenographic analysis of vertebral inclination on sagittal plane in asymptomatic versus chronic low back pain patients.</TITLE>Two homogenous groups of 120 volunteers and 120 low back pain (LBP) patients, age range 20-79 years, underwent a prospective roentgenographic segmental vertebral analysis of the thoracic and lumbar spine to compare several roentgenographic parameters useful for planning spine surgery. The following roentgenographic parameters were measured: thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral inclination, distal lordosis (L4-S1), inclination of each vertebra from T4-S1, and relative vertebral inclination between adjacent vertebrae. Thoracic kyphosis increased (p < 0.0001) and sacral inclination decreased (p < 0.05) with age in the control group. Increased thoracic kyphosis correlated with decreased lumbar lordosis after the sixth decade in the control group (p < 0.01), less so in the LBP group (p < 0.05). Increased thoracic kyphosis was seen more in the LBP group than in the controls, but significantly solely in the sixth decade (p < 0.01). Lumbar lordosis was more increased in the controls than in the LBP group but significantly solely in the sixth decade (p < 0.001). The L5-S1 segmental lordosis was much more in the LBP patients than in the controls (p < 0.001). Lumbar lordosis was strongly correlated with sacral inclination in both groups (p < 0.0001) and it was significantly greater in the controls, particularly in the sixth decade (p < 0.001). Sacral inclination was significantly more in the female than in male volunteers (p < 0.05). Distal lordosis (L4-S1) represents 55% and 49% of total lumbar lordosis in controls and low back patients, respectively. Spine surgeons frequently deal with sagittal spinal deformities and the deviations of sagittal spinal curvatures and vertebral inclination in the sagittal plane, both in normal subjects and LBP patients should be clinically helpful.

10285085	<TITLE>What can patient health education coordinators learn from ten years of compliance research?</TITLE>Research in compliance with medication prescriptions and life style changes that affect health status has yielded recommendations that, along with implications from recent theory development, need to be applied in the general practice of medicine and preventive medicine. For patients to benefit from the research it must be used by their care providers in a consistent way. To accomplish this means that the findings from past research need to be applied on an institutional basis. Hospitals, health maintenance organizations and health departments must incorporate these findings into their standards of care for their patients and clients to benefit. This paper reviews the previous articles in this special compliance collection and then discusses ways patient health education coordinators can apply them in their practice and influence their use by other practitioners.

10323297	<TITLE>Kinetic and energetic patterns for hindlimb obstacle avoidance during cat locomotion.</TITLE>The safe control of walking over different terrains requires appropriate adaptations in the dynamic and kinematic limb patterns. To date, the study of locomotor dynamics in the cat has been confined to level, unobstructed walking. The present study extends the work of Lavoie et al. by applying linked segment analyses to estimate muscle contributions to torque and mechanical power at the hindlimb joints of two female cats during both unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance. Data during obstacle avoidance were analyzed both when the hindlimb led in clearance and was farthest from the obstacle, and when it trailed in clearance and was closest or near to the obstacle. It was found that, in both the Far and Near obstructed conditions, the cats cleared the obstacles primarily by increasing the knee flexor torque already used during unobstructed gait. Contributions from the hip and ankle muscle groups were more variable. There was more emphasis on the hip extensors in mid to late stance, and the hip flexors generated a small amount of energy at paw-lift in the Far condition. In the Near condition, the hip extensors were employed to control hip flexion. We suggest that hip flexor generation power in mid-swing contributes to the clearance of the upcoming obstacle in the Far condition while, in the Near condition, hip flexion advances the already extended limb ahead of the obstacle. The ankle was actively dorsiflexed in the Near condition but was maintained in extension in the Far condition. The emphasis on active knee flexor control by the cat to avoid obstacles, as well as the dependence of ankle control on obstacle proximity, is similar to strategies seen for humans. However, the knee flexor strategy is innate to the cat's normal level walking control, whereas in humans active knee flexion at toe-off requires a reorganization from level, non-obstructed gait.

10340486	<TITLE>Isolation and characterization of a subtractive library enriched for developmentally regulated transcripts expressed during encystation of Toxoplasma gondii.</TITLE>To survive within infected hosts, Toxoplasma gondii undergoes profound metabolic and morphological changes by differentiating into a cyst characterized by its resistance to the immune system and chemotherapy. The stimulus that triggers Toxoplasma encystation and the molecular mechanisms regulating the bradyzoite phenotype are still unknown. Here, we developed a differentiation method in conjunction with a selective and subtracted cDNA strategy devised to identify developmentally regulated transcripts. We isolated and analyzed 65 cDNA clones. In addition to bradyzoite specific cDNAs previously reported, we demonstrate that twelve genes are exclusively or preferentially transcribed in the encysted bradyzoite forms of T. gondii using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Among cDNAs identified, are those encoding predicted homologues of chaperones (mitochondrial heat shock protein 60, T-complex protein 1), DNA-damage repair protein, phosphatidylinositol synthase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and enolase. The identification of these genes opens the way for further study of molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression during T. gondii encystation.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10409195	<TITLE>A CD18 monoclonal antibody reduces multiple organ injury in a model of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.</TITLE>The role of CD18 antibody (anti-CD18) in remote and local injury in a model of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was investigated. Rats were divided into sham, shock, clamp, and shock + clamp groups. Shock + clamp animals received anti-CD18 or a control monoclonal antibody. One hour of hemorrhagic shock was followed by 45 min of supramesenteric aortic clamping. Intestinal and pulmonary permeability to (125)I-labeled albumin was determined. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, F(2)-isoprostane levels, and transaminases were also measured. Only shock + clamp resulted in statistically significant increases in pulmonary and intestinal permeability, which were associated with significant increases in MPO activity and F(2)-isoprostane levels. Treatment with anti-CD18 significantly decreased intestinal and pulmonary permeability in shock + clamp animals. These reductions were associated with significantly reduced intestinal and hepatic MPO activity and pulmonary F(2)-isoprostane levels and reduced alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels; however, anti-CD18 had no effect on intestinal or hepatic F(2)-isoprostane levels or on pulmonary MPO activity. These results suggest CD18-dependent and -independent mechanisms of local and remote organ injury in this model of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

10417755	<TITLE>Evaluation of clinically applicable exsanguination treatments to alleviate venous congestion in an animal skin flap model.</TITLE>This study compares the effectiveness of alleviating venous congestion with mechanically-made outlets or leech therapy in promoting skin flap survival. Free flaps of abdominal skin (3 x 6 cm) were raised on Sprague-Dawley rats and subjected to ischemic events, simulating venous congestion. Animals received 1) no treatment; 2) two treatments involving two 18-gauge needle-puncture outlets; or 3) two sessions of leech therapy. Flap perfusion was monitored with a scanning laser Doppler flowmeter. Photographic images of flaps at 7 days were assessed for areas of normal tissue (n = 15), and laser Doppler flowmeter data consisted of control (n = 6), outlet (n = 6), and leech (n = 7). Both the needle-puncture outlet (40.0% +/- 9.24%) and leech treated (34.6% +/- 7.34%) groups had a significantly greater surviving skin area than untreated control flaps (8.0% +/- 5.0%), with 2 of 15 flaps receiving mechanical outlets exhibiting > 90% surviving area. After 7 days, laser Doppler flowmeter data showed greater mean perfusion in the outlet (71.7% +/- 16.8%) and leech (92.6% +/- 17.2%) treated groups, compared to controls (15.2% +/- 10.2%). There was a significant increase in perfusion in the outlet (13.3% +/- 6.2%) and leech (9.1% +/- 1.1%) treated groups from the end of secondary ischemia to day 7 (p < 0.05) compared to controls. The results suggest that two spatially separated outlets are as effective as one leech in increasing the area of surviving skin in venous congested flaps.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10421879	<TITLE>Dopamine D1-receptor immunolocalization in goldfish retina.</TITLE>Dopamine, a neuromodulator in the vertebrate retina, is involved in numerous functions related to light adaptation. However, unlike in mammals, localization of retinal D1-dopamine receptors in nonmammalian vertebrates has been hampered due to a lack of antisera. To address this problem, an antiserum against the 18 C-terminal amino acids of the goldfish D1 receptor (gfD1r) was generated in chicken eggs and tested in retinae of goldfish and rat, and rat caudate putamen, by using immunoblots and light microscopic immunocytochemistry. No labeling was observed in any tissue or immunoblots with preabsorbed gfD1r antiserum. Immunoblot analysis of goldfish retina revealed a single band at about 101 kDa. The patterns of gfD1r immunoreactivity (gfD1r-IR), found in rat caudate putamen and rat retina were virtually identical to that previously reported with other D1-receptor ligands and antisera. In goldfish retina, gfD1r-IR was most intense over cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer, amacrine cells in the proximal inner nuclear layer (INL), and bipolar cells in the distal INL. Weaker gfD1r-IR was observed over horizontal cell bodies and both plexiform layers. Müller cells and axons of cone photoreceptors were labeled as well. Double labeling showed that all protein kinase C-immunoreactive bipolar cells (ON type) were gfD1r-IR on the soma, axon terminal, and dendrites. All glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive (i.e., gamma-aminobutyric acid utilizing) amacrine cells and horizontal cells were gfD1r-IR. Retinal D1r distribution is more extensive than dopamine neuron innervation, but is consistent with physiologic estimates of dopamine function, suggestive of both wiring and volume transmission of dopamine in the retina. The gfD1r antiserum displays cross-reactivity to dopamine receptors in a mammal and a nonmammal and should prove useful in future studies of dopaminergic systems.

10425176	<TITLE>Unusual self-association properties of transthyretin Y114C related to familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy: effects on detection and quantification.</TITLE>We performed biochemical and immunological examinations of heterozygotic carriers of the transthyretin (TTR) mutant Y114C associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). The total serum TTR levels in Y114C TTR carriers were extremely low when analyzed by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID), whereas by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure, their total TTR concentrations were increased. Recombinant homozygotic Y114C TTR showed no immunoreactivity towards a TTR antibody when analyzed by SRID, whereas by the ELISA procedure presented the same degree of reactivity as that of normal TTR or isolated serum heterozygotic Y114C TTR. These results indicate that immunodifusion based techniques cannot properly determine TTR serum levels in Y114C carriers. Analyses of serum TTR of the Y114C TTR carriers by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the orifice corn voltage at 60 V revealed a small peak of the free Y114C TTR in addition to large TTR peaks of normal TTR. The levels of the free mutant TTR increased with the orifice corn voltage at 90 V. In contrast, increase in orifice voltage from 60 to 90 V produced a reduction in the level of normal TTR. The results suggest a different pattern of association between monomers in Y114C relative to normal TTR.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10425725	<TITLE>The amino acid sequence of a lamprey (Entosphenus japonicus) liver fatty acid-binding protein identified its close relationship to cardiac fatty acid-binding proteins of Mammalia.</TITLE>Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) constitute a large, tissue-specific multigene family in animals. While liver FABPs of Aves, Reptilia, and Amphibia are close homologs of mammalian liver FABPs, the shark liver protein belongs to the mammalian heart FABP subfamily. We purified an FABP from the liver of lamprey, Entosphenus japonicus, by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography. Amino acid sequences determined for lysyl endopeptidase peptides covered nearly the entire molecule except for N- and C-terminal short segments. Examination of the phylogenetic relationship from the sequence identified the lamprey liver protein as a member of mammalian heart-type FABPs. Since livers of bony fish contain both hepatic and cardiac FABPs, expression of the FABP gene in the vertebrate liver appears to change from the heart-type to liver-type within Pisciformes, with bony fish being in a transition stage. This may be related to the evolutionary and physiological divergence of liver function and lipid metabolism of these lower vertebrates.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10449410	<TITLE>Resistance to endotoxic shock as a consequence of defective NF-kappaB activation in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 deficient mice.</TITLE>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein that participates in the DNA base excision repair pathway in response to genotoxic stress in mammalian cells. Here we show that PARP-1-deficient cells are defective in NF-kappaB-dependent transcription activation, but not in its nuclear translocation, in response to TNF-alpha. Treating mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the rapid activation of NF-kappaB in macrophages from PARP-1(+/+) but not from PARP-1(-/-) mice. PARP-1-deficient mice were extremely resistant to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. The molecular basis for this resistance relies on an almost complete abrogation of NF-kappaB-dependent accumulation of TNF-alpha in the serum and a down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to decreased NO synthesis, which is the main source of free radical generation during inflammation. These results demonstrate a functional association in vivo between PARP-1 and NF-kappaB, with consequences for the transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and a systemic inflammatory process.

10469633	<TITLE>A deficiency in a 230 kDa DNA repair protein in fanconi anemia complementation group A cells is corrected by the FANCA cDNA.</TITLE>Cells from individuals with the cancer-prone, inherited disorder Fanconi anemia (FA) are hypersensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents and this hypersensitivity correlates with a defect in ability to repair this type of damage to their DNA. We have isolated a DNA endonuclease complex from the nuclei of normal human cells which is involved in repair of DNA interstrand cross-links and have shown that in FA complementation group A (FA-A) cells there is a defect in ability of this complex to incise DNA containing interstrand cross-links. In order to identify the specific protein(s) in this complex which is defective in FA-A cells, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed against proteins in the normal complex. One of these mAbs, which is against a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 230 kDa, completely inhibited the ability of the normal complex to incise cross-linked DNA. Western blot analysis has shown that there is a deficiency in this protein in FA-A cells. Electophoretic analysis has also indicated that there are reduced levels of this protein in FA-A compared with normal cells. Studies carried out utilizing FA-A cells which have been stably transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the FANCA cDNA have shown that the DNA repair defect in these cells has been corrected; levels of unscheduled DNA synthesis are at least as great as those of normal human cells. In addition, in the transduced cells the deficiency in the 230 kDa protein has been corrected, as determined by both western blot and electrophoretic analysis. These results indicate that the FANCA gene plays a role in the expression or stability of the 230 kDa protein.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10513287	<TITLE>Antiserum generated by DNA vaccine binds to hepatitis E virus (HEV) as determined by PCR and immune electron microscopy (IEM): application for HEV detection by affinity-capture RT-PCR.</TITLE>Previously, we have described that injection of an expression vector containing hepatitis E virus (HEV) open reading frame 2 (HEV-ORF-2) generated a strong antibody response in mice. To characterize the reaction of this antiserum with native HEV and to evaluate its potential diagnostic application, we tested the antiserum's ability to bind HEV using immune electron microscope (IEM) and affinity-capture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. Antiserum to ORF-2 aggregated HEV virions as seen by electron microscopy, providing direct evidence that ORF-2 encodes a structural protein. Antiserum also captured HEV for RT-PCR amplification. This antiserum bound HEV from diverse origins (Asia, Africa, Mexico) at virus concentrations found in patient fecal specimens and bile from inoculated non-human primates. The specificity of the affinity binding was demonstrated when pre-immune sera or sera collected from mice injected with control DNA vector (lacking the HEV ORF-2 gene) failed to bind HEV for RT-PCR amplification and IEM. Specific RT-PCR amplification was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products. The sensitivity of the binding was evaluated by RT-PCR amplification of serially diluted bile containing a genetically divergent HEV, Mexico'86. HEV was detected in a 10(-8) dilution of this bile. This is the first report that antibodies elicited by a DNA vaccine recognize native HEV. Our results indicate that ORF-2 encodes a structural protein and that antiserum to this protein enables simple, sensitive, and specific HEV detection by affinity-capture RT-PCR.

10537231	<TITLE>Augmentation and suppression of action potentials by estradiol in the myometrium of pregnant rat.</TITLE>The purpose of this study was to investigate the actions of estradiol on spontaneous and evoked action potentials in the isolated longitudinal smooth muscle cells of the pregnant rat. Single cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion from pregnant rat longitudinal myometrium. Action potentials and currents were recorded by whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp methods, respectively. The acute effects of 17beta-estradiol on action potentials and inward and outward currents were investigated. The following results were obtained. The average resting membrane potential of single myometrial cells was -54 mV (n = 40). In many cells, an electrical stimulation evoked a membrane depolarization, and action potentials were superimposed on the depolarization. In some cells, spontaneous action potentials were observed. Estradiol (30 microM) slightly depolarized the membrane (ca. 5 mV) and attenuated the generation of action potentials by reducing the frequency and amplitude of the spikes. Afterhyperpolarization was also attenuated by estradiol (30 microM). On the other hand, in 5 of 35 cells, estradiol increased the first spike amplitude and action potential duration, while frequency of the spike generation and afterhyperpolarization were inhibited. In voltage-clamped muscle cells, estradiol inhibited both inward and outward currents. Acute inhibition or augmentation of spike generation by estradiol is due to the balance of inhibition of inward and outward currents. Inhibition of both currents also prevented afterhyperpolarization, causing potential-dependent block of Ca spikes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10554970	<TITLE>Downregulation of kappa opioid receptor mRNA levels by chronic ethanol and repetitive cocaine in rat ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens.</TITLE>The combination of ethanol and cocaine is commonly abused by human addicts which has serious clinical consequences. Here, the effects of separately and concurrently administered ethanol and 'binge' cocaine on kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mRNA in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats were studied. KOR mRNA was down-regulated in both brain regions during concurrent as well as separate treatment with these drugs. In the VTA, the most pronounced decrease was obtained following combined treatment with ethanol and 'binge' cocaine. In the NAc, the strongest decrease was observed in the 'binge' cocaine group. This profound decrease of KOR mRNA in regions important for brain reward suggests a potential role of the KOR system in the abuse of cocaine and ethanol.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

10599382	<TITLE>Joint replacement. The final solution?</TITLE>Joint replacement is now a well established procedure that provides pain relief, mobility and stability to arthritic joints. The development of hip and knee replacement surgery is used to highlight some basic principles of joint replacement. The results of total knee replacements performed by the senior author were analysed in two separate, 2 to 5 year follow-up studies using the Scoring System of The Knee Society of America. Both studies confirm the reproducible, good results of this procedure. Indeed, the demand for this type of surgery has increased and in Malta, at present, the number of knee replacements performed out-numbers hip replacements by two to one. After total knee replacement rheumatoid arthritis patients have results that compare well with those of osteoarthritis patients. These patients, in particular, should benefit from early joint replacement.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10602948	<TITLE>Peripheral MR angiography.</TITLE>Atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities is a common disorder in western society. Its debilitating nature calls for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The gold standard for diagnosing this disease by depiction of vessel morphology is X-ray angiography (either conventional or digital subtraction angiography). However, the invasive nature of this technique and the possible harmful effects of iodinated contrast agents have led to the idea that non-invasive MR angiography might be a good alternative for acquiring information about vessel morphology. Most extensively studied was time-of-flight MR angiography. Although first results with this technique were encouraging, it is now apparent that time-of-flight MR angiography is hampered by the virtue of which it exists, since blood flow not only generates vessel-to-background contrast, but is also the cause of disturbing artifacts. However, with the introduction of minimally invasive contrast-enhanced MR angiography, using gadolinium chelates to reduce the T1 of blood, image quality has improved dramatically. Moreover, using contrast-enhanced MR angiography, high-resolution three-dimensional data about the entire peripheral vascular tree can be obtained within several minutes, which might make MR angiography a true competitor of X-ray angiography as a diagnostic tool in the clinical work-up of a patient with complaints of peripheral atherosclerosis. The purpose of this article is to explain working mechanisms and usefulness of both time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced MR angiography.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Analysis of the generic questionnaires revealed poorer quality of life parameters in comparison to a general population, although better results were sometimes observed in younger patients (under 45 years), patients without cancer, and patients with more than one care-giver. Nevertheless, the patients' subjective assessment of the changes in their quality of life since beginning HEN was generally good, with most patients reporting improved or stable mental and physical well-being.|Quality of life is poor in HEN patients, but subgroups of patients who score better in some quality of life dimensions can be identified. Most patients describe an improvement in their quality of life following the initiation of HEN that needs to be confirmed by a prospective study.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10704461	<TITLE>Immunotherapy with dendritic cells directed against tumor antigens shared with normal host cells results in severe autoimmune disease.</TITLE>Vaccination with dendritic cells (DCs) presenting tumor antigens induces primary immune response or amplifies existing cytotoxic antitumor T cell responses. This study documents that antitumor treatment with DCs may cause severe autoimmune disease when the tumor antigens are not tumor-specific but are also expressed in peripheral nonlymphoid organs. Growing tumors with such shared tumor antigens that were, at least initially, strictly located outside of secondary lymphoid organs were successfully controlled by specific DC vaccination. However, antitumor treatment was accompanied by fatal autoimmune disease, i.e., autoimmune diabetes in transgenic mice expressing the tumor antigen also in pancreatic beta islet cells or by severe arteritis, myocarditis, and eventually dilated cardiomyopathy when arterial smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes expressed the transgenic tumor antigen. These results reveal the delicate balance between tumor immunity and autoimmunity and therefore point out important limitations for the use of not strictly tumor-specific antigens in antitumor vaccination with DCs.

10719904	<TITLE>First derivative spectrophotometric and LC determination of benoxinate hydrochloride and its degradation products.</TITLE>Two methods are presented for the determination of benoxinate HCI and its acid and alkali-induced degradation products using first derivative (1D) spectrophotometry with zero-crossing measurements and liquid chromatography. Benoxinate HCl was determined by measurement of its first derivative amplitude in mcllvaine's-citric acid phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 268.4 and 272.4 nm in the presence of its alkali- and acid-induced degradation products, respectively. The acid- and alkali-induced, degradation products were determined by measurement of their first derivative amplitude in the same solvent at 307.5 nm. The LC method depends upon using a mu bondapak CN column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water triethylamine (60:40:0.01, v/v) and adjusted to apparent pH 7. Quantitation was achieved with UV detection at 310 nm based on peak area. The proposed methods were utilized to investigate the kinetics of the acidic and alkaline degradation processes at different temperatures. The pH-rate profile of degradation of benoxinate HCl in Britton-Robinson buffer solutions was studied.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10780584	<TITLE>Medical therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease in secondary and tertiary care settings.</TITLE>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common. Many patients with recurring or troublesome symptoms are referred for endoscopic examination. Patients seen in secondary care usually have failed OTC or primary care anti-reflux therapy. Acid suppression is the mainstay of healing and maintenance therapy. Increasingly proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are preferred above H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), not only for the more severe end of the GERD spectrum but also for patients with mild degrees of esophagitis. Not all patients respond symptomatically to acid suppression, not even with high dose PPI. Prokinetics are mainly useful in the milder degrees of GERD. It is still not clear whether a particular symptom cluster can be recognized for which prokinetics are especially useful. The concept of "step-up versus step-down" approach remains in need for proper validation. Switching from PPIs to cisapride for "step-down" maintenance appears inadequate in practice. All current therapies have shortcomings; H2RAs insufficiently block meal-stimulated acid secretion; long-term strong acid suppression worsens Helicobacter pylori-associated inflammation in the corpus and may accelerate development of atrophy; PPI-potency is substantially weaker in non-H. pylori infected individuals. Optimization of individualized therapy will require more potent and more precisely targeted motility modulating drugs and superior acid/peptic inhibiting pharmaceuticals.

10782998	<TITLE>Binding of selenoprotein P to heparin: characterization with surface plasmon resonance.</TITLE>The binding of selenoprotein P to glycosaminoglycans using heparin as a model compound was studied by surface plasmon resonance. It was found that heparin contains two binding sites for selenoprotein P, a high-affinity, low-capacity site (Kd approximately 1 nM) and a low-affinity, high-capacity site (Kd approximately 140 nM). Binding at both sites is sensitive to pH and ionic strength, and the high-affinity site is abolished by histidine carbethoxylation with diethylpyrocarbonate. The pH and salt dependence of binding suggests electrostatic interactions with heparin. The concentrations of selenoprotein P in plasma (approximately 50 nM) are sufficiently high to facilitate binding of selenoprotein P to proteoglycans on the vascular endothelium, and this may contribute to the formation of a protective barrier against oxidants such as peroxynitrite or hydroperoxides.

This "binocular inhibition" is not related to the contrast sensitivity of the better eye or to acuities. Furthermore, this inhibition process is reflected primarily in images with medium to low spatial frequency components (medium to large size bars).|These results have important implications for understanding the functional impact of low vision in older people. They suggest that almost one-half of older people with AMD view the world best using only one of their eyes, whereas for the other half, there is an advantage to using binocular vision for certain visual tasks.

10881997	<TITLE>Morphologic changes in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virions secondary to intravirion reverse transcription: evidence indicating that reverse transcription may not take place within the intact viral core.</TITLE>In the past, retroviral endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) was considered an artificial process, secondary to permeabilization of the viral envelope by detergents or amphipathic peptides. However, recently we have demonstrated that ERT may occur in a variety of lentiviruses without detergent treatment and may lead to increased infectivity of lentivirions in initially quiescent T lymphocytes and nonproliferating cells, such as macrophages. As full-length reverse transcripts could be synthesized within lentiviral particles, it is worth evaluating the potential alterations in lentiviral morphology due to the stimulation of intravirion reverse transcription.|Using quantitative DNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we characterized critical alterations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions after stimulation of intravirion reverse transcription.|Intravirion reverse transcription in HIV-1 virions was stimulated using deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and physiologic polyamines. Our studies indicated that HIV-1 virions, in which intravirion reverse transcription was stimulated, showed dissolution of the p24-shelled viral core and absence of the core-envelope linkage (CEL) region by TEM. These changes in the structure of the core correlate with the in vitro alterations in virion infectivity on primary cells.|Stimulation of intravirion HIV-1 reverse transcription leads to morphologic changes in the viral particles that suggest changes in the compact viral core, which is consistent with active reverse transcription before infection of target cells. Further, via this unique approach, we suggest that intravirion or intracellular reverse transcription of HIV-1 is unlikely to take place within intact viral cores made up of p24-containing outer shells. As such, these results suggest a new approach to further dissect the intravirion or intracellular reverse transcription machinery of lentiviruses.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10904854	<TITLE>Progress toward vaccines against viruses that cause heart disease.</TITLE>Of the numerous viruses that have been implicated as causes of viral inflammatory cardiomyopathy, only the 6 serotypes of the group B coxsackieviruses (CVB 1-6) and adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) have been regularly linked to heart disease on the basis of both clinical investigations as well as animal models (in the case of the coxsackieviruses). Of these, only the coxsackieviruses offer a truly well-characterized system for not only investigations using a small animal disease model (myocarditis in mice) but for studies of the virus at the molecular level and in cell culture systems. The pending worldwide eradication of the related enteroviruses, the polioviruses, will further emphasize the importance of the coxsackieviruses in years to come. Studies using poliovirus have shown that enteroviruses can be attenuated for disease to create highly successful and safe human vaccines. Furthermore, using recombinant DNA approaches, strains of polioviruses have been created that demonstrate a human enterovirus can express small proteins as well as foreign antigenic epitopes, thus creating multivalent chimeric vaccine strains of virus. Our laboratory has been exploring coxsackievirus 3-based vectors as models for both multivalent chimeric vaccines as well as expression vectors. The coxsackievirus can be successfully attenuated using both point mutations as well as chimeric genome technology. The coxsackievirus can also express intact small proteins in biologically active form as well as antigenic epitopes. Although it is doubtful that the marketplace will support the development of antiviral vaccines to combat human heart disease at present, the technology exists to make such vaccines a reality.

10928573	<TITLE>The Bradykinesia Akinesia Incoordination Test (BRAIN TEST), an objective and user-friendly means to evaluate patients with parkinsonism.</TITLE>The BRAIN TEST, a computerized alternating finger tapping test, was performed on 154 patients with parkinsonism to assess whether the test could be used as an objective tool to evaluate reliably the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients were instructed to tap two marked computer keyboard keys as fast and as accurately as possible for 60 seconds. The test generates the following variables: (1) kinesia score (KS)--number of keystrokes/min, (2) akinesia time (AT)--cumulative time that keys are depressed, (3) dysmetria score (DS)--a weighted score generated from incorrectly hit keys and corrected for speed, and (4) arrhythmia score (AS)--variance of the time interval between individual keystrokes. Among parkinsonian patients, we found a significant correlation between the four test parameters and PD rating scores of the Hoehn & Yahr, Schwab & England, and Unified PD Rating Scales (KS, AS, and AT p <0.001 and DS p <0.05). When compared with 73 parkinsonian patients 73 age- and sex-matched control subjects showed significantly higher KS and lower AT (p <0.001) as well as lower DS and AS (p = 0.05). The BRAIN TEST is a reliable and practical tool for evaluating the severity of parkinsonism and for distinguishing subjects with parkinsonism from normal control subjects. A version of the BRAIN TEST is available by FTP on the worldwide web (http://www.anaesthetist.com/software/brain.htm).	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10946404	<TITLE>Synergic activities of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and lipoteichoic acid in cytokine induction.</TITLE>The present study was carried out to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and other acute invasive diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). Specifically, since both whole bacteria and their soluble products are often present in the blood in these conditions, we sought to detect possible synergic activities of somatic and extracellular products in inducing mediators release. For this purpose, whole blood cultures from healthy donors were incubated with different concentrations of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA), which is considered a major molecular effector of TSS, heat-killed GAS and cell-wall components such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and soluble peptidoglican (sPGN). Significant levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma were found in supernatants from cultures incubated with each of the four inducers alone. Whole GAS and both cell-wall components were more effective (p < 0.05) than SpeA in inducing cytokine release. Whole GAS, at weight basis, was a more potent inducer than LTA and sPGN and LTA, at weight basis, was a more potent inducer than sPGN. In order to verify possible additive or synergic effects of exotoxic and parietal compounds in inducing cytokine release, whole blood cells were incubated with mixtures of SpeA and LTA at different molecular ratio. TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma levels in supernatants were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in supernatants of cultures stimulated simultaneously with the two components than those of cultures stimulated with a single agent. Moreover, these levels were significantly higher than the sum of cytokine levels induced by single components. This study shows that parietal compounds can act in synergy with exotoxins in inducing the release of cytokines, which appear to be the major mediators of TSS.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
10971017	<TITLE>Arealization of the neocortex in mammals: genetic and epigenetic contributions to the phenotype.</TITLE>The neocortex is composed of areas that are functionally, anatomically and histochemically distinct. In comparison to most other mammals, humans have an expanded neocortex, with a pronounced increase in the number of cortical areas. This expansion underlies many complex behaviors associated with human capabilities including perception, cognition, language and volitional motor responses. In the following review we consider data from comparative studies as well as from developmental studies to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in arealization, and discuss how these mechanisms may have been modified in different lineages over time to produce the remarkable degree of organizational variability observed in the neocortex of mammals. Because any phenotype is a result of the complex interactions between genotypic influences and environmental factors, we also consider environmental, or epigenetic, contributions to the organization of the neocortex.

10972814	<TITLE>DNase I homologous residues in CdtB are critical for cytolethal distending toxin-mediated cell cycle arrest.</TITLE>Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) block cell division by arresting the eukaryotic cell cycle at G2/M. Although previously not recognized in standard BLAST searches, a position-specific iterated (PSI) BLAST search of the protein data bank using CDT polypeptides as query sequences indicated that CdtB bears significant position-specific homology to type I mammalian DNases. The PSIBLAST sequence alignment reveals that residues of DNase I involved in phosphodiester bond hydrolysis (His134 and His252) are conserved in CdtB as well as their respective hydrogen bond pairs (Glu78 and Asp212). CdtB also contains a pentapeptide motif found in all DNase I enzymes. Further, crude CDT preparations possess detectable DNase activity not associated with identical preparations from control cells. Five CdtB mutations in amino acids corresponding to DNase I active site residues were prepared and expressed together with wild-type CdtA and CdtC polypeptides. Mutation in four of the five DNase-specific active site residues resulted in CDT preparations that lacked DNase activity and failed to induce cellular distension or arrest division of HeLa cells. The fifth mutation, Glu86 (Glu78 in DNase I), retained the ability to induce a moderate level of cell cycle arrest and displayed reduced DNase activity relative to wild-type CDT. Together, these data suggest that the CDT holotoxin has intrinsic DNase activity that is associated with the CdtB polypeptide and that this DNase activity may be responsible for the CDT-induced cell cycle arrest.

11053225	<TITLE>Endothelial nitric oxide synthase is a site of superoxide synthesis in endothelial cells treated with glyceryl trinitrate.</TITLE>Tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) involves superoxide (O(2)(*-)) production by endothelial cells. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces O(2)(*-) when L-arginine (L-arg) is limited. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that GTN stimulates NOS to increase O(2)(*-) synthesis in endothelial cells when L-arg is limited. Production of O(2)(*-) by bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC, passages 3 - 5) was determined by spectrophotometrically measuring superoxide dismutase-inhibited reduction of ferricytochrome C to ferrocytochrome C. Cells were incubated in buffer without L-arg. O(2)(*-) production was measured using BAEC either untreated or treated with L-NAME or L-arg alone or following treatment with GTN (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) for 30 min or DPTA NONOate (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) alone or with GTN or DPTA NONOate after pretreatment with nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), L-arg or their inactive enantiomers, D-NAME or D-arg (all 5 x 10(-4) M) (n=6 - 7/group). L-NAME alone produced a 69% reduction in O(2)(*-) levels. Treatment with L-arg alone had no effect. Cells treated with GTN alone exhibited an increase in O(2)(*-). This effect was prevented by pretreatment with either L-NAME or L-arg, and was unaffected by D-NAME or D-arg. We observed a dose-response relationship in O(2)(*-) production to GTN over a range of 10(-9) to 10(-7) M. The NO donor, DPTA-NONOate, unlike GTN, did not have a significant effect on O(2)(*-) production. In conclusion, endothelial NOS is a site of O(2)(*-) synthesis in endothelial cells activated by GTN.

11054380	<TITLE>JC virus DNA sequences are frequently present in the human upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.</TITLE>JC virus (JCV), a human polyomavirus, has been found in a limited number of normal human tissues and cancers. The oncogenic potential of this virus is mediated by a transforming protein, the T antigen (TAg). We have previously demonstrated the presence of JCV-TAg in colorectal cancers, in adjacent normal colonic mucosa from these patients, and in the human colon cancer cell line SW480. The mode of transmission of this virus is unclear, and we hypothesized that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may be a reservoir for the virus.|DNA was extracted from 129 normal GI tissue samples collected from 33 patients. Topoisomerase I-assisted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the virus using exact and degenerate primers. Nested PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed the identity of the PCR products. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing were used to evaluate the presence of viral quasispecies.|JCV sequences were found in 75.8% of patients (70.6% of upper GI and 81.2% of colonic samples); no significant differences in rates of infection were found by site. The use of degenerate primers combined with topoisomerase I treatment led to viral detection in 58.9% of samples, compared with 27.9% of samples using exact primers and topoisomerase I (P < 0.01). SSCP and sequencing analysis confirmed the amplification of viral quasispecies and the authenticity of TAg sequences.|The results show that JCV DNA sequences are highly prevalent in the human upper and lower gastrointestinal tract of immunocompetent individuals.

11084378	<TITLE>Effect of acetaminophen on heme metabolism in rat liver.</TITLE>Acetaminophen (APAP) or paracetamol is a hepatotoxic drug through mechanisms involving oxidative stress. To know whether mammalian cells possess inducible pathways for antioxidant defense, we have to study the relationship between heme metabolism and oxidative stress.|fasted female Wistar rats received a single injection of APAP (3.3 mmol kg(-1) body weight) and then were killed at different times. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO), delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, ALA dehydratase, and porphobilinogenase activities, lipid peroxidation, GSH, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, were measured in liver homogenates. The antioxidant properties of bilirubin and S-adenosyl-L-methionine were also evaluated.|APAP increased lipid peroxidation (115% +/- 6; S.E.M., n=12 over control values) 1 h after treatment. GSH reached a minimum at 3 h (38% +/- 5) increasing thereafter. At the same time antioxidant enzymes reached minimum values (catalase, 5. 6 +/- 0.4 pmol mg(-1) protein, glutathione peroxidase, 0.101 +/- 0.006 U mg(-1) protein). HO induction was observed 6 h after treatment reaching a maximum value of 2.56 +/- 0.12 U mg(-1) protein 15 after injection. ALA synthase (ALA-S) induction occurred after enhancement of HO, reaching a maximum at 18 h (three-fold the control). ALA dehydratase activity was first inhibited (31 +/- 3%) showing a profile similar to that of GSH, while porphobilinogenase activity was not modified along the whole period of the assay. Administration of bilirubin (5 micromol kg(-1) body weight) or S-adenosyl L-methionine (46 micromol kg(-1) body weight) 2 h before APAP treatment entirely prevented the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the decrease in GSH levels as well as HO and ALA-S induction.|This study shows that oxidative stress produced by APAP leads to increase in ALA-S and HO activities, indicating that toxic doses of APAP affect both heme biosynthesis and degradation.

11087497	<TITLE>Storage proteins from Lathyrus sativus seeds.</TITLE>The proteins from Lathyrus sativus Linn. (chickling vetch or grass pea) seeds were investigated. Protein constitutes approximately 20% of the seed dry weight, >60% of which is composed by globulins and 30% by albumins. A single, 24 kDa polypeptide comprises more than half of the protein present in the albumin fraction. The globulins may be fractionated into three main components, which were named alpha-lathyrin (the major globulin), beta-lathyrin, and gamma-lathyrin. alpha-Lathyrin, with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 18S, is composed of three main types of unglycosylated subunits (50-66 kDa), each of which produce, upon reduction, a heavy and a light polypeptide chain, by analogy with 11S. beta-Lathyrin, with a sedimentation coefficient of 13S, is composed by a relatively large number of subunits (8-66 kDa). Two major polypeptides are glycosylated and exhibit structural similarity with beta-conglutin from Lupinus albus. One of these possesses an internal disulfide bond. gamma-Lathyrin, with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5S, contains two interacting, unglycosylated polypeptides, with no disulfide bonds: the major 24 kDa albumin and the heavier (20 kDa) polypeptide chain of La. sativus lectin.

11147150	<TITLE>Experimental and clinical assessment of the accuracy of knee extension measurement techniques.</TITLE>The purpose of this study was to analyze the accuracy of commonly used techniques for the measurement of knee extension and to compare them with a new measurement device. The bars of an external fixator were used to determine reference knee extension angles of 15 human cadavers. These angles were compared with measurements of knee extension on radiographs limited to the knee joint. Extension was determined in various knee positions using a generic goniometer and a novel long arm goniometer. In a clinical study, two independent examiners categorized knee extension performance according to the IKDC. Sixteen knees with deficits in the range of motion were rated using a generic goniometer, a long arm goniometer and the novel extension measurement device. The radiological measurement of knee extension angles that were restricted to the shaft of femur and tibia had a systematic error of -5.2 +/- 1.9 degrees compared with the lines created by the centers of rotation. In the experimental setup, the mean absolute deviations were 3.92 +/- 1.41 degrees with a generic goniometer and 1.22 +/- 0.20 degrees with the extension measurement device. The variance of the measurements was significantly lower (2.64 +/- 0.28) than with the generic goniometer (23.72 +/- 4.39; P < 0.05). Correspondence in the IKDC rating was 63% using a standard goniometer, 50% with the long arm goniometer, and 96% using the novel device. Radiological measurements of knee extension limited to the area of the knee joint deviates systematically from measurements of the total axis of the bones. A precision goniometer that utilizes bony landmarks of the tibia and femur is superior in accuracy compared with standard and long arm goniometer techniques.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
11153004	<TITLE>Self-sterilizing and self-cleaning of silicone catheters coated with TiO(2) photocatalyst thin films: a preclinical work.</TITLE>TiO(2) photocatalysts were successfully coated on silicone catheters or medical tubes by pretreatment of the silicone surface with a sulfuric acid solution (5 M) for 3 h. The TiO(2) film adhered to the silicone substrate strongly against tensile and bending stresses. On the TiO(2)-coated silicone-catheters under UV illumination, both the bleaching of methylene blue dye and the photocatalytic bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells were confirmed. Thus, this type of catheter can be sterilized and cleaned simply by irradiation with low-intensity UV light and can, therefore, be useful in the protection from catheter-related bacterial infections.

11259312	<TITLE>High-sensitivity fluorescence anisotropy detection of protein-folding events: application to alpha-lactalbumin.</TITLE>An experimental procedure has been devised to record simultaneously fluorescence intensity and fluorescence anisotropy. A photoelastic modulator on the excitation beam enables the anisotropy signal to be recorded in one pass using a single photomultiplier tube and eliminates the need for a polarizer on the emission path. In conjunction with a stopped-flow mixer, providing a time-resolved capability, this procedure was used to study the refolding of apo alpha-lactalbumin following dilution from guanidinium chloride. Although the fluorescence intensity does not change detectably, the fluorescence anisotropy was found to resolve the conformational changes occurring between the initial unfolded state and the molten globule state formed either kinetically during refolding at pH 7.0 or at equilibrium at pH 2.0 (A-state). This result provides further evidence that fluorescence anisotropy is a valuable probe of protein structural transitions and that the information it provides concerning the rotational mobility of a fluorophore can be complementary to the information about the local environment provided by fluorescence intensity.

11327716	<TITLE>Cloning and expression of activator of CREM in testis in human testicular tissue.</TITLE>Activator of cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) in testis (ACT) has recently been found in the mouse testis where it activates CREM, a transcription factor essential for the differentiation of spermatids into mature spermatozoa. The importance of CREM in human spermatogenesis prompted us to examine whether ACT was also present in the human testis. Western blot analysis, performed with an anti-mouse ACT serum, showed the presence of a single immunoreactive band of a size similar to murine ACT. A library screening resulted in the isolation and characterization of the complete cDNA which showed 88% homology with the mouse counterpart. The human ACT gene is composed of five coding exons, being the first untranslated, and the mRNA spans 835 nucleotides coding for a 284 amino acid protein. Expression studies by RT-PCR confirmed that ACT is present in normal human testis. The human ACT gene is localized on the chromosome 6.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
11351277	<TITLE>Uptake of D-mannoheptulose by normal and tumoral pancreatic islet cells.</TITLE>D-mannoheptulose was recently proposed as a possible tool to label preferentially insulin-producing cells in the pancreatic gland. In the present study, D-[3H]-mannoheptulose uptake by rat pancreatic islets or dispersed islet cells was found to represent a time-related and temperature-sensitive process inhibited by cytochalasin B. This mould metabolite also inhibited the efflux of D-[3H]-mannoheptulose from prelabelled islets. After 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C, the apparent intracellular distribution space of the tritiated heptose was close to or somewhat higher than that of D-[5-3H]glucose and close to 50% of the intracellular 3HOH space. It was further enhanced by D-glucose and a high concentration of 10 mM of D-mannoheptulose. The uptake of D-[3H]mannoheptulose was much lower however than that of D-[3H]mannoheptulose hexaacetate. As judged from the fate of D-mannoheptulose hexa[2-14C]acetate, the latter ester was efficiently hydrolyzed in the islet cells. The internalization of D-[3H]mannoheptulose (or its ester) coincided with the generation of tritiated acidic metabolites, reflecting phosphorylation of the heptose. The situation found in normal islet cells sharply differed from that found in tumoral islet cells of either the RINm5F or INS-1 line, in which the apparent distribution space of D-[3H]mannoheptulose represented only about 3 and 9%, respectively, of the intracellular 3HOH space. These results indicate that the entry of D-mannoheptulose into islet cells represents a carrier-mediated process, possibly mediated at the intervention of GLUT2 and, hence, provide further support to the possible use of a suitable D-mannoheptulose analog as a tool for the preferential labelling of insulin-producing cells in the pancreatic gland.

11396514	<TITLE>Repeated cocaine administration does not alter morphine-induced rotational behavior in nigrally denervated rats.</TITLE>Repeated administration of morphine to rats increases their sensitivity to behavioral effects of morphine as well as to those of psychomotor stimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine. Conversely, stimulant-induced sensitization to behavioral effects of stimulants often results also in sensitization to behavioral effects of morphine. However, in nigrally lesioned rats, repeated injections of morphine produce sensitization to morphine-induced turning but not to turning induced by cocaine or amphetamine. The present study was performed to determine whether giving repeated cocaine injections to nigrally lesioned rats would produce cross-sensitization to morphine-induced turning. Daily injections of 10 mg/kg cocaine (i.p.) enhanced the turning response to cocaine by day 8, but not the turning response to 3.0 mg/kg morphine (s.c.). The response to morphine increased equally in both cocaine- and saline-treated animals after they had received morphine once. Dose-response curves for morphine (1.0-10 mg/kg) and for cocaine (3.0-30 mg/kg), determined during weeks 3 and 4, were the same in rats receiving daily injections of cocaine or daily injections of saline. Thus, although repeated exposure to cocaine or morphine resulted in sensitization to turning induced by each drug, respectively, there was no cross-sensitization between the two drugs. In contrast to other behaviors, rotational behavior does not seem to exhibit cross-sensitization between morphine and psychomotor stimulants.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
11460177	<TITLE>Symptomatic muscle involvement in neurosarcoidosis: a clinicopathological study of 5 cases.</TITLE>We report on the clinical course and histopathologic muscle alterations of five patients diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis, who underwent biopsy due to their muscle manifestations. The five patients were females and only one was less than 40 years of age. Proximal muscle weakness was presented by all and only two patients complained of myalgia. Only normal values of serum muscle enzymes were detected. Electromyography revealed diverse findings such as normal, myopathic and neuropathic patterns. Granuloma was not present in one muscle biopsy. Two patients thoroughly recovered by taking only prednisone and one patient required a methotrexate addition for 3 months before becoming asymptomatic. The other two patients received azathioprine, one due to steroid side effects but without a satisfactory evolution, and the other to strengthen the prednisone régime, with excellent results.

11505629	<TITLE>Clinical varieties of mastocytoses.</TITLE>Varieties of the clinical features of mastocytoses, also called mastocytosis syndrome, are presented. The disease is characterized by excessive accumulation of mast cells, their proliferation and action in the skin and other organs, even in the central nervous system. The mastocytosis syndrome was known as early as the second half of the 19th century under the term urticaria pigmentosa, and was histologically confirmed by the presence in the dermis of metachromatic cells, i.e. Ehrlich mast cells with red-purple cytoplasmic granules visible with Giemsa or toluidine blue stains. The mastocytosis syndrome was then supposed to be a benign chronic dermatosis of childhood with spontaneous regression by adolescence. The clinically pathognomonic symptoms of Darier's sign (urtication of primary skin lesion upon rubbing) and flushing help in the diagnosis of mastocytosis syndrome. In the 1950s, there was a progression in the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis achieved by scientists and clinicians of various specialties. Upon the discovery of many mast cell released mediators (heparin, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, proteases, cytokines), receptor functions, relationship to IgE, anaphylatoxin, etc., they were recognized as triggers of various clinical features of the mastocytosis syndrome. In this paper, different forms of cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis are described, with special reference to 'mastocytosis mucocutanea haemorrhagica' observed by one of the authors in a female infant and followed from 6 months till 2.5 years of age. The patient showed practically all the diverse forms of cutaneous mastocytosis: urticaria pigmentosa, papular, nodular, tumorous-like melanoma, vesiculobullous, erythrodermic, telangiectasia eruptiva maculosa perstans. She also suffered from nasal and rectal hemorrhage, conjunctival suggillations, plaque-like infiltrations of the glossal, oropharyngeal and laryngotracheal mucosa, episodes of flushing, and transitory apnea. It is emphasized that the diagnosis of mastocytosis syndrome may be difficult for its mimicking various other diseases. The occurence of mastocytosis syndrome from the neonatal period through adult and old age, and possibilities of symptomatic treatment and prevention of sudden death or fatalities are discussed. Familial occurrence of mastocytosis syndrome and new genetic studies that may prove highly useful for understanding the etiopathogenesis of mastocytosis syndrome are described.

11516597	<TITLE>Fatigue in ambulatory patients with advanced lung cancer: prevalence, correlated factors, and screening.</TITLE>Although it has been indicated that patients with lung cancer experience higher level of fatigue than patients with other cancers, few published studies have focused on the characteristics of this fatigue and how it interferes with daily activities. The purpose of this study was to clarify fatigue prevalence and the factors correlated with fatigue, and to develop a screening method for fatigue in patients with advanced lung cancer. One hundred fifty-seven patients completed two fatigue scales (Cancer Fatigue Scale [CFS], and Fatigue Numerical Scale [FNS]) plus other measures, along with a self-administered questionnaire asking whether fatigue had interfered with any of 7 areas of daily activities. Fifty-nine percent of patients had experienced clinical fatigue, which was defined as fatigue that interfered with any daily activities. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that symptoms of dyspnea on walking, appetite loss, and depression were significant correlated factors. Both CFS and FNS were found to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for use as a screening tool. The results indicated that fatigue is a frequent and important symptom, which is associated with both physical and psychological distress in this population. The CFS and FNS were confirmed to have sufficient screening ability.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Cress plants (Lepidium sativum) grown in medium containing Brz exhibited a slight predominance of phloem differentiation at the expense of xylem differentiation and remarkable inhibition of the development of secondary xylem. This result indicates that brassinosteroids function in xylem development in vivo.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
11704355	<TITLE>Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of pathologic conditions of the middle ear.</TITLE>Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent technique for demonstrating even small abnormalities of the thin and complex bony structures of the middle ear. For this reason, it is the modality of choice in the study of conductive hearing loss (CHL). However, not every patient complaining of CHL requires a CT study. In fact, established indications encompass complex conditions, such as the complications of acute and chronic otomastoiditis, the postoperative ear in chronic otomastoiditis or in the localization of prosthetic devices, and the assessment of congenital or vascular anomalies. Particularly, the precise extent of bone erosion associated with cholesteatoma is correctly demonstrated by high resolution CT. Conversely, although fistulization through the tegmen tympani or the posterior wall of temporal bone is usually detectable by CT, the actual involvement of meninges and veins are better assessed by magnetic resonance (MR). MR is also indicated when complicated inflammatory lesions are suspected to extend into the inner ear or towards the sigmoid sinus or jugular vein. Neoplasms arising from or extending into the middle ear require the use of both techniques as their combined data provide essential information. Most important data for surgical planning concern the destruction of thin bony structures and the relationships of the lesion with the dura and surrounding vessels. DSA and interventional vascular techniques maintain an essential role in the presurgical work-up and embolization of paragangliomas extended into the middle ear.

11747432	<TITLE>Three-dimensional structure of the argininosuccinate lyase frequently complementing allele Q286R.</TITLE>Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) catalyzes the reversible breakdown of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate, a reaction involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in all species and in the production of urea in ureotelic species. In humans, mutations in the enzyme result in the autosomal recessive disorder argininosuccinic aciduria. Intragenic complementation has been demonstrated to occur at the ASL locus, with two distinct classes of ASL-deficient strains having been identified, the frequent and high-activity complementers. The frequent complementers participate in the majority of the complementation events observed and were found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for a glutamine to arginine mutation at residue 286. The three-dimensional structure of the frequently complementing allele Q286R has been determined at 2.65 A resolution. This is the first high-resolution structure of human ASL. Comparison of this structure with the structures of wild-type and mutant duck delta1 and delta2 crystallins suggests that the Q286R mutation may sterically and/or electrostatically hinder a conformational change in the 280's loop (residues 270-290) and domain 3 that is thought to be necessary for catalysis to occur. The comparison also suggests that residues other than R33, F333, and D337 play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of domain 1 and reinforces the suggestion that residues 74-89 require a particular conformation for catalysis. The electron density has enabled the structure of residues 6-18 to be modeled for the first time. Residues 7-9 and 15-18 are in type IV beta-turns and are connected by a loop. The conformation observed is stabilized, in part, by a salt bridge between the side chains of R12 and D18. Although the disease causing mutation R12Q would disrupt this salt bridge, it is unclear why this mutation has such a significant effect on the catalytic activity as residues 1-18 are disordered in all other delta-crystallin structures determined to date.

11873822	<TITLE>The influence of different food sources on cercarial production in Lymnaea truncatula experimentally infected with Digenea.</TITLE>Experimental infections of Lymnaea truncatula with a digenean species (Fasciola gigantica, F. hepatica, or Paramphistomum daubneyi) were performed under laboratory conditions to study the effect of four sources of food (microalgae, romaine lettuce, wheat germs, or modified Boray diet) on cercarial production. The mean number of F. hepatica, F. gigantica, or P. daubneyi cercariae was significantly greater when snail food was microalgae or Boray diet. The lowest cost prices for 100 metacercariae of F. hepatica (9.7-10.1 euros) were noted when algae of Boray diet were used as food for snails. In contrast, the highest prices (18.0-18.5 euros) were found in lettuce-reared snails. The choice of a source of food for breeding the intermediate hosts of F. hepatica and collecting metacercariae must take into account the importance of the commercial demand for metacercariae and will depend on the strategy the producer wishes to develop.

11908530	<TITLE>AgCl detectors in the Biostack II experiment aboard Apollo 17.</TITLE>Two layers of AgCl detectors with a total surface of 90 cm2 were flown. Tracks of nuclei, from light (Z>4) up to the heaviest were recorded and could be distinguished by their geometrical trackwidths. The tracks were divided into five groups of atomic numbers, and their abundance was measured. Also the number of surviving nuclear stars was counted. 22.5 cm2 of the detector surface were covered with eggs of Artemia salina. The detectors could be developed without removing the eggs, so that the spots hit could be determined directly. The radiation effect on these eggs is being investigated.

Discussions, which were recorded and organized according to category and theme, focused on problems in living with migraines and effective treatment of migraines.|Participants were 24 people who had been experiencing 1 to 2 migraines a month, each lasting 1 to 2 days, for at least 6 months.|Five themes emerged: (1) impact on family, (2) misunderstanding by others, (3) effect on work, (4) physician care issues, and (5) issues related to medical insurance and drug companies. A majority of participants identified early treatment as the most important consideration for new migraine sufferers. Many participants preferred to have a relationship with their physicians in which they developed a treatment plan together rather than receiving generic educational materials.|Results suggest that patients are interested in understanding their migraines and securing relevant information in addition to obtaining pain relief. Patients desired collaborative relationships with their physicians and a team approach to treatment. Suggestions for physicians who treat patients who have migraines are reviewed.

12011083	<TITLE>Differences in the regulation of the classical and the alternative pathway for bile acid synthesis in human liver. No coordinate regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1.</TITLE>It has been reported that there is a coordinate regulation of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in rats. Thus, the levels of the mRNA corresponding to these two enzymes were found to change in the same direction in rat liver and in isolated rat hepatocytes. In contrast, other groups have not seen such regulation of CYP27A1 in rabbit liver or in rat liver when using an activity assay. In the present work, the effect of bile acid treatment on human CYP27A1/luciferase reporter activity was studied in a transient transfection assay in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. Neither the endogenous 27-hydroxylase activity nor the CYP27A1/luciferase reporter activity were down-regulated by treatment of HepG2 cells with chenodeoxycholic acid or taurochenodeoxycholic acid. We also measured CYP27A1 mRNA and CYP7A1 mRNA in liver of humans subjected to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor and a combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and cholestyramine. There was a 60-fold variation in the levels of CYP7A1 mRNA but only a 5-fold variation in the levels of CYP27A1 mRNA. There was no correlation between the two mRNA species. It is concluded that, in humans, there is little or no coordinate regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 at the transcriptional level, and that CYP27A1 is not subject to a negative feedback control by bile acids. The results underline that marked species differences may exist in mechanisms for control of synthesis of bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12060690	<TITLE>Improved detection of small deletions in complex pools of DNA.</TITLE>About 40% of the genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have homologs in humans. Based on the history of this model system, it is clear that the application of genetic methods to the study of this set of genes would provide important clues to their function in humans. To facilitate such genetic studies, we are engaged in a project to derive deletion alleles in every gene in this set. Our standard methods make use of nested PCR to hunt for animals in mutagenized populations that carry deletions at a given locus. The deletion bearing animals exist initially in mixed populations where the majority of the animals are wild type at the target. Therefore, the production of the PCR fragment representing the deletion allele competes with the production of the wild type fragment. The size of the deletion fragment relative to wild type determines whether it can compete to a level where it can be detected above the background. Using our standard conditions, we have found that when the deletion is <600 bp, the deletion fragment does not compete effectively with the production of the wild type fragment in PCR. Therefore, although our standard methods work well to detect mutants with deletions >600 bp, they do not work well to detect mutants with smaller deletions. Here we report a new strategy to detect small deletion alleles in complex DNA pools. Our new strategy is a modification of our standard PCR based screens. In the first round of the nested PCR, we include a third PCR primer between the two external primers. The presence of this third primer leads to the production of three fragments from wild type DNA. We configure the system so that two of these three fragments cannot serve as a template in the second round of the nested PCR. The addition of this third primer, therefore, handicaps the amplification from wild type template. On the other hand, the amplification of mutant fragments where the binding site for the third primer is deleted is unabated. Overall, we see at least a 500-fold increase in the sensitivity for small deletion fragments using our new method. Using this new method, we report the recovery of new deletion alleles within 12 C.elegans genes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12070930	<TITLE>Concentrating ability of the kidneys in proteinuric patients.</TITLE>Proteinuria causes damage to renal tubulointerstitum. The study included 50 patients (24 males and 26 females), mean age 46.50 +/- 13.08 years, with average endogenous creatinine clearance 87.29 +/- 31.17 ml/min. Regarding level of glomerular proteinuria patients were divided into three groups. The first group, with proteinuria less than 0.3 g/24 h, included 19 patients (7 male and 12 female), average age 45.12 +/- 13.28 years and mean clearance of endogenous creatinine 94.27 +/- 34.70 ml/min. The second group, with proteinuria between 0.3 and 3.0 g/24 h, comprised 18 patients (8 male and 10 female), mean age 45.39 +/- 12.64 years, and with mean clearance of endogenous creatinine 90.07 +/- 31.89 ml/min. The third group consisted of 13 patients (9 male and 4 female) with proteinuria values higher than 3.0 g/24 h, average age 50.08 +/- 13.73 years and mean endogenous creatinine clearance 73.25 +/- 20.44 ml/min. In order to assess the concentrating ability of the kidneys we investigated: urine osmolality, osmolar concentration index, fractional osmolar excretion, fractional urea excretion and free water clearance. Results were statistically analyzed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi 2 test. Proteinuria leads to deterioration of concentrating ability of the kidneys.

12073778	<TITLE>Trifluoromethyl ketones show culture age-dependent inhibitory effects on low K(+)-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons.</TITLE>We previously reported that two trifluoromethyl ketones, 3,3,3-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione (TF1) and 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-phenyl-2-propanone (TF2), have neuroprotective effects against low K(+)-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) exposed at 12-13 days in vitro (DIV). On the other hand, these compounds showed weak neuroprotective potency against 7 DIV CGNs. It is reported that actinomycin D (Act-D), cycloheximide (CHX), and caspase-3 inhibitors prevent the apoptosis of CGNs induced by K+ deprivation. However, these experiments are generally performed using 7 DIV CGNs. We investigated and compared the antiapoptotic efficacy of these drugs and newly-discovered TF1 and TF2 to protect DIV 7 and 12-13 CGNs from death induced by K+ deprivation. Apoptosis of CGNs induced by K+ withdrawal at 13 DIV was potently inhibited by Act-D and CHX similar to those at 7 DIV. Caspase-3 inhibitors moderately suppressed cell death during low K(+)-induced apoptosis both exposed 7 and 13 DIV. Serine protease inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone (TPCK) had no effect on K(+)-deprivation-induced apoptosis of CGNs at both 7 and 12 DIV. This study showed that there are different pathways of apoptosis in CGNs depending on the culture age.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The treatment was termed DOXCAM. Effectiveness of therapy was assessed with frequency-volume charts, an IC symptom score and with cystometry prior to treatment, 8 weeks after the start and 4 weeks after termination of drug treatment.|Medication was not tolerated by five patients. Twenty-six of 32 patients have experienced virtual total remission of symptoms (81%) and six patients had significant relief (19%). DOXCAM treatment resulted in a significant percent decrease in pain (65% versus 21%). Daytime frequency decreased from 17.6+/-5.7 to 11.3+/-3.6 voids while nocturia did not improve significantly. Twenty-three of the 26 patients who became symptom free and four of the six patients who showed significant improvement had a return of symptoms after cessation of therapy.|It is reasonable to consider oral treatment with DOXCAM in those patients who have failed first-line therapies.

Thirty-seven patients completed both brain scans following randomization. Rectosigmoid stimulation was performed with a computer-controlled barostat. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow were assessed using H215O positron emission tomography. Stimulus ratings and changes in gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using verbal descriptor scales.|Alosetron, but not placebo, treatment was associated with a decrease in symptom ratings, and reductions in emotional stimulus ratings. Compared to baseline, alosetron treatment was associated with reduced regional cerebral blood flow in bilateral frontotemporal and various limbic structures, including the amygdala. Compared to placebo, decreases in activity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, hypothalamus and infragenual cingulate gyrus were significantly greater after alosetron.|In non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients, 3 weeks of treatment with a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist decreases brain activity in response to unanticipated, anticipated and delivered aversive rectal stimuli in structures of the emotional motor system, and this is associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal symptoms.

12182437	<TITLE>A cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic third ventriculostomy.</TITLE>Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is currently the principal alternative to cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement in the management of pediatric hydrocephalus. Cost-effectiveness analysis can help determine the optimal strategy for integrating these different approaches.|All patients (n = 28) who underwent ETV at British Columbia's Children's Hospital between 1989 and 1998 were matched for age, pathogenesis, and number of previous shunt procedures, with patients treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts. To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, hydrocephalus-related resource consumption and outcome (determined as the number of hydrocephalus treatment-free days during follow-up) were then retrospectively identified. Cost data were linked to resource use to provide a total cost for all resources used. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 5% by standard economic analysis methods.|Twenty-four of 28 ETV patients had obstructive hydrocephalus. Over equivalent follow-up periods (median, 35 mo), the ETV success rate (defined by need for reoperation) was 54%. One hydrocephalus-related death and one hemiparesis occurred in the ETV group. No permanent procedure-related morbidity or mortality was seen in the shunt group. The cost/effect ratios for the two groups were similar. The additional incremental resource use by the shunt group included six readmissions and eight reoperations. ETV mean costs per patient were $10,570 +/- $7628, versus $10,922 +/- $8722 for the shunt group (Canadian dollars for the year 2000). Costs accrued more quickly for the shunt group as time passed. The additional incremental outcome benefit to the endoscopy group was 86 treatment-free days (3.07 d per patient [95% confidence interval, -7.56 to 13.70 d]). Neither of these differences was statistically significant.|In this matched cohort, ETV was not significantly less costly or more effective over a median 35 months of follow-up, with a 54% initial ETV success rate, even before the additional morbidity and mortality encountered were taken into account. The time course for the accrued costs suggests that a larger cohort, longer follow-up, or higher success rates are needed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy.

12489475	<TITLE>Surgical and endoscopic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.</TITLE>There is no evidence to advocate medical or surgical therapy as the best therapy for GERD. The decision to have antireflux surgery must be individualized. All patients taking long-term medications for GERD should receive advice on the safety and wisdom of staying on that therapy and information on antireflux surgery. Fundoplication should be considered in three circumstances [4]: 1. Patients who are intolerant of PPI therapy because of side effects should be considered for surgery. This situation will be less common now with five PPIs, however. 2. Patients who are poorly responsive to PPI therapy should be considered for surgery. This situation is probably not common, given the effectiveness of the currently available PPIs. It is more common in patients with atypical GERD. The gastroenterologist should be as certain as possible that the patient not only has GERD, but also that the patient's symptoms are reflux related. 3. Surgery should be considered when patients desire a permanent solution to free them of the need to take medications. These patients must be warned about the potential suboptimal results, including the frequent need for medication within a few years of having the procedure and the small but real possibility of becoming worse after the operation. Even in experienced hands, 1% to 2% of patients are worse after the procedure. A careful preoperative evaluation to ensure that the patient's symptoms are reflux related and that the right operative procedure is performed offers the patient the best opportunity for success. Widespread use of endoscopic therapy for GERD is probably still several years away. The best endoscopic therapy is yet to be determined, but it will need to be safe, effective, and easy to use.

The authors conducted this study to present information on the effects of rural residence on oral health in the United States.|The authors conducted their analyses using data from adults aged 18 to 64 years from the 1995, 1997 and 1998 National Health Interview Surveys and the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, 1988-94. The authors present national estimates for various oral health status indicators including dental insurance coverage, unmet care needs, frequency of dental visits, caries experience and prevalence of edentulism by rural/urban residence.|The authors found that adults living in rural areas were more likely to report having unmet dental care needs and were less likely to have had a dental visit in the past year compared with adults living in urban areas. The prevalence of edentulism among rural adults was 16.3 percent-almost twice that of urban adults. Caries experience also was more likely to be greater among adults residing in rural areas.|Oral health disparities exist among U.S. adults living in rural and urban areas. Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to report a dental visit in the past year and were more likely to be edentulous.|By understanding the rural/urban differences in adult oral health status, practitioners, policy-makers and rural health advocates will have better information to use to promote activities that better meet the needs of rural adults in the United States.

The final element that needs to be established in a negligence case is that the defendant's breach of duty was the cause of the claimant's loss and that this loss was not too far removed or remote from the actions of the defendant. The law involved in this area can be quite difficult to understand as some of the principles used are uncertain and the cases can be quite hard to draw together and reconcile.

The study explored changes during the CFP in students' perceptions of the risk of addiction and their attitudes towards analgesics. The results revealed that although the students had a more accurate view of the risk of addiction by the end of the CFP there was still an exaggerated fear of the risk of addiction in over half the students. Follow-up interviews with 14 students also indicated that students displayed a more general wariness in relation to the use of analgesics.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12571676	<TITLE>NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Polyvinyl Alcohol (CAS No.9002-89-5) in Female B6C3F1 Mice (Intravaginal Studies).</TITLE>Polyvinyl alcohol is produced primarily for use in textile sizing, adhesives, polymerization aids, and paper coatings. It is also used in surgical drapes, towels, and gauze sponges; protective gloves; cosmetic formulations; topical ophthalmic preparations; plastic sponge implants for reconstructive surgery; and intravaginal contraceptive foam and film. In addition, polyvinyl alcohol is used with magnesium sulfate to dilate the cervix of women prior to induction of labor. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of women in the United States use an intravaginal product containing polyvinyl alcohol each year. The Food and Drug Administration nominated low-viscosity polyvinyl alcohol for a 2-year study because of concern about the lack of information about the long-term toxic and carcinogenic effects by the intravaginal route. Female B6C3F1 mice received polyvinyl alcohol (approximately 99% pure) in deionized water by intravaginal administration for 30 days or 2 years. 30-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Three groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice were used in this intravaginal study. The vehicle control group received only 20 &mgr;L of a deionized water vehicle. The other two groups each received 20 &mgr;L of 25% polyvinyl alcohol in deionized water. Animals in one dose group were returned to their cages after dosing; animals in the other dose group were restrained in a vertical nose-down position in restraint bags for several minutes after dosing. Animals were dosed daily for 30 consecutive days. All mice survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed mice were similar to those of the vehicle control group. Abnormalities noted in the vaginal area after dosing included vaginal plugs, secretions, and swelling. These vaginal changes were minimal to mild and occurred in vehicle controls as well as in dosed mice. Restraint of mice after dosing appeared to eliminate vaginal secretions but increased both the incidence of vaginal irritation and the severity of vaginal opening swelling. At necropsy, mildly enlarged uterine horns were observed in 10 vehicle control mice, three 25% mice, and seven 25% (restrained) mice. No chemical-related lesions were observed. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Three groups of 100 female B6C3F1 mice were used in this intravaginal study: an untreated control group, a vehicle control group receiving 20 &mgr;L deionized water vehicle only, and a dosed group receiving 20 &mgr;L 25%% polyvinyl alcohol in deionized water. Animals were dosed 5 days per week, excluding holidays, for 104 to 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed mice was similar to that of the two control groups. The final mean body weight of vehicle control mice was less than that of the untreated control group. The mean body weights of the dosed mice were less than those of the untreated controls from week 17 until the end of the study. The only clinical finding was vaginal irritation, observed in six mice in the vehicle control group and 11 mice in the dosed group. Pathology Findings: No neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions related to chemical treatment were observed. The incidences of reproductive tract nonneoplastic lesions in the dosed group did not differ significantly from those in the vehicle control group; similarly, the incidences of reproductive tract nonneoplastic lesions in the vehicle control group did not differ significantly from those in the untreated control group. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of polyvinyl alcohol (molecular weight approximately 24,000) in female B6C3F1 mice administered 20 &mgr;L of a 25%% solution intravaginally. There were no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions considered related to treatment with polyvinyl alcohol.

We studied the kinetics of in vitro allergen-, tuberculin (PPD)- and tetanus toxin (TT)-induced IFN-gamma and IL-4 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures of pollen-allergic patients and healthy controls.|PBMC of 10 birch or timothy pollen-allergic patients and of 13 healthy controls were stimulated in vitro with allergen (birch or timothy), PPD or TT. Pellets and supernatants were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after stimulation. IFN-gamma and IL-4 production was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and mRNA expression using RT-PCR and time-resolved fluorometry.|Allergen induced IFN-gamma production and mRNA expression in PBMC more in allergic patients than in healthy controls. Also allergen induced IL-4 mRNA expression more in allergic patients than in healthy controls. PPD induced IFN-gamma mRNA expression both in allergic patients and healthy controls, whereas IFN-gamma production was induced only in healthy controls and IL-4 was not induced at all. TT induced IFN-gamma mRNA expression in both groups, IFN-gamma production in allergic patients, and IL-4 mRNA expression in both allergic patients and healthy controls.|In vitro stimulation with allergen induced both IFN-gamma and IL-4 mRNA expression of PBMC in allergic patients. These observations challenge the clearcut division of microbe-specific Th1 and allergen-specific Th2 responses in peripheral blood.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12611906	<TITLE>A missense mutation in the Abcg5 gene causes phytosterolemia in SHR, stroke-prone SHR, and WKY rats.</TITLE>Sitosterolemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 half-transporter genes. These mutations disrupt the mechanism that distinguishes between absorbed sterols and is most prominently characterized by hyperabsorption and impaired biliary elimination of dietary plant sterols. Sitosterolemia patients retain 15-20% of dietary plant sterols, whereas normal individuals absorb less than 1-5%. Normotensive Wistar Kyoto inbred (WKY inbred), spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) strains also display increased absorption and decreased elimination of dietary plant sterols. To determine if the genes responsible for sitosterolemia in humans are also responsible for phytosterolemia in rats, we sequenced the Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes in WKY inbred, SHR, and SHRSP rat strains. All three strains possessed a homozygous guanine-to-thymine transversion in exon 12 of the Abcg5 gene that results in the substitution of a conserved glycine residue for a cysteine amino acid in the extracellular loop between the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning domains of the ATP binding cassette half-transporter, sterolin-1. The identification of this naturally occurring mutation confirms that these rat strains are important animal models of sitosterolemia in which to study the mechanisms of sterol trafficking.

12627459	<TITLE>Distribution of haplotypes derived from three common variants of the NR4A2 gene in Japanese patients with schizophrenia.</TITLE>Dysregulation in dopaminergic neurotransmission might play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and therefore genetic components of the dopamine (DA) pathway may confer risk. The NR4A2 (Nurr1) gene is essential for the development and maintenance of mesencephalic DA-synthesizing neurons. Moreover, Nurr1 forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and disturbances in the retinoid-signaling cascade may be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia. To investigate the potential genetic contribution of NR4A2, we performed a case-control association study using three common variants in the gene [-2922(C)2-3, IVS6 + 17 approximately +18insG, EX8 + 657(CA)9-10] that were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. We did not detect a significant allelic or genotypic association. Haplotypes derived from all three polymorphisms generated similar results. These data do not support the notion that the NR4A2 gene plays a major role in risk for schizophrenia among Japanese individuals.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Resident fibroblasts are thought to contribute to inflammatory cell infiltration through chemokine production.|We sought to provide insight into the clinical differences apparent among these allergic diseases of the eye, skin, and lung, and we compared the abilities of corneal, dermal, and lung fibroblasts to produce TARC and MDC.|The amounts of chemokines released into the culture supernatant were determined by means of ELISA, and the intracellular abundance of chemokine mRNAs was quantitated by means of reverse transcription and real-time PCR analysis.|Neither TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, nor IL-13 alone induced the release of TARC from or affected the amount of TARC mRNA in corneal, dermal, or lung fibroblasts. The combination of TNF-alpha with either IL-4 or IL-13, however, markedly increased both TARC release and the abundance of TARC mRNA in corneal and dermal fibroblasts, but not in lung fibroblasts. Neither MDC release nor MDC mRNA was detected in any of the 3 types of fibroblasts stimulated with any of the cytokines examined.|These results indicate that cytokine regulation of TARC expression differs among fibroblasts derived from the cornea, skin, or lung. Corneal and dermal fibroblasts might thus be important sources of TARC during allergic inflammation.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12655317	<TITLE>Neurotrophic effects of electroconvulsive therapy: a proton magnetic resonance study of the left amygdalar region in patients with treatment-resistant depression.</TITLE>Negatively balanced neurotrophic factors may be important in precipitating clinical depression. Recently, it has been reported that antidepressant therapy may exert positive neurotrophic effects. The aim of this study was to detect probable neurotrophic changes during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). For this purpose, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), an amino acid exclusively located in neurons, and other brain metabolites such as glutamine/glutamate (Glx), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr) were measured in patients by localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 28 severely depressed patients (DSM-IV) were enrolled, and the left amygdalar region was investigated by proton STEAM spectroscopy before and after unilateral ECT. The results were compared with 28 age- and gender-matched controls using nonparametric paired and unpaired tests. A significant increase in NAA was observed only in ECT responders (n=14; p=0.019). Five out of 14 nonresponders to ECT monotherapy were remeasured following a clinical improvement after continued ECT combined with antidepressants and were then found also to present a significant increase in NAA. In all successfully treated patients, parallel observations, that is, increased levels, were made for Glx, whereas Cho and Cr were unchanged. In conclusion, our preliminary finding of increased NAA concentrations after successful ECT may indicate a probable neurotrophic effect of ECT.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12693658	<TITLE>Endoscopic anatomy of the sphenopalatine and posterior nasal arteries: implications for the endoscopic management of epistaxis.</TITLE>Refractory posterior epistaxis is a challenge for otolaryngologists. Most algorithms for managing this condition ultimately call for interrupting the arterial blood supply to the nasal mucosa. Traditionally, this was accomplished either by transantral arterial ligation or by arteriographic-guided embolization. More recently, the endonasal endoscopic approach has also been described. Because the primary blood supply to the posterior nasal cavity is derived from the terminal branches of the sphenopalatine and the posterior nasal arteries, we conducted this anatomic study to examine and describe the anatomic relationship of these two arteries as they exit the pterygopalatine fossa and enter the nasal cavity.|We performed endoscopic dissections of this anatomic region in nine fresh and one formalin-preserved cadaver specimens. A total of 19 sides were examined.|In 3 of 19 specimens (16%), the sphenopalatine artery branched from the sphenopalatine artery within the sphenopalatine canal, allowing the two arteries to exit together. In 8 of the 19 specimens (42%), the sphenopalatine artery exited much more posteriorly, yet from within a shared posteriorly elongated sphenopalatine foramen. In the remaining eight specimens (42%), the sphenopalatine artery exited through a distinct foramen directly posterior to the larger sphenopalatine foramen.|Understanding this anatomic relationship is important in performing endoscopic arterial ligation. If the sphenopalatine artery is not specifically identified and ligated, an important component of the posterior nasal circulation will not be addressed adequately by this surgical approach.

12710327	<TITLE>Biventricular pacing exclusively via a persistent left-sided superior vena cava: case report.</TITLE>Biventricular pacing in association with a persistent left-sided superior vena cava is technically challenging. The presence of an associated innominate vein enables a conventional approach via the right atrium for coronary sinus intubation and left ventricular lead placement. In its absence, the coronary sinus lead must be positioned exclusively via the left-sided superior vena cava. The acute angulation of the branch ostia encountered when catheterizing the coronary sinus "downstream" makes this difficult, but with the use of preshaped cardiac catheters and over-the-wire pacing leads selective intubation of a left ventricular vein is possible.

Among men with bronchitis, weak, nonsignificant positive associations were observed between activity and these outcomes, with the exception of noncardiovascular mortality.|The suggestion of a positive activity-mortality association among individuals with chronic bronchitis-albeit weak and nonsignificant-requires further investigation.

12723589	<TITLE>Pulmonary resection with chest wall removal and reconstruction for invasive pulmonary mucormycosis during antileukemia chemotherapy.</TITLE>A 54-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia developed invasive pulmonary mucormycosis in the right upper lobe at the neutropenic nadir. Amphotericin B therapy became ineffective after an abscess formed in the affected lung, and insufficient infection control compelled us to interrupt chemotherapy. The lesion was suspected of invading the anterior chest wall. After right upper lobectomy combined with the anterior chest wall resection, the chest wall defect was reconstructed using autologous free rib grafts. Successful control of the fungal infection by resection enabled us to restart chemotherapy with concomitant use of Amphotericin B. In selected cases of leukemia-associated pulmonary mucormycosis refractory to Amphotericin B therapy, aggressive surgical intervention may facilitate anti-leukemia chemotherapy and prolong survival.

12786234	<TITLE>Critical dynamics of the Gaussian model with multispin transitions.</TITLE>In this paper, we present a multispin transition mechanism, which is an extension of the Glauber one, to investigate critical dynamics. By exactly solving the master equation, the influence of the multispin transition mechanism on the dynamic critical behavior is studied for the Gaussian model with nearest-neighbor interactions on d-dimensional lattices (d=1, 2, and 3). The time evolution of magnetization is exactly calculated, and the exact results of relaxation time and dynamic critical exponent are obtained. Our models are divided into two kinds: one is the spin-cluster transition and the other is the arbitrary multispin transition. It is found that there are different relaxation times, but the same dynamical critical exponent for different kinds of multispin transitions. The results show that the dynamical critical exponents are independent of spatial dimensions and configurations of transitional spins, and that the dynamical critical exponent is the same as that of the Glauber dynamics, and thus give a strong support to the simple single-spin-transition dynamics. Finally, we give a brief discussion on the results.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12800267	<TITLE>Prosthodontic treatment of the edentulous adult cleft palate patient.</TITLE>Clefts of the upper lip and plate are relatively common, yet dental treatment of these patients is still very poor and many grow up suffering dental neglect. Dental practitioners should become involved in the treatment team as dental needs are present from birth to death. Adult cleft patients often need tooth replacement with obturation of any residual clefts. They are best treated with tooth-supported removable appliances including partial and complete overdentures, thus preservation of their natural dentition is desirable. Edentulous cleft palate patients present with restorative difficulties due to their compromised maxillary arches as well as the presence of scar tissue in their palates and lips. An outline of these complications and guidelines for their treatment is illustrated in the form of three case reports from members of one family all presenting with varying cleft lip and palate defects. This article highlights the need for dental students to be exposed to dentally compromised patients so that they will feel confident enough to treat them in private practice.

12818464	<TITLE>Association of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms with bone mineral density in postmenopausal women of Hellenic origin.</TITLE>There are numerous indications that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, a common condition characterized by reduced bone mass and increased fracture risk. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene has been suggested as a possible candidate gene for the regulation of bone mass but the relationship between VDR polymorphisms and bone mineral density (BMD) is controversial and has not been confirmed by all workers in different ethnic groups studied.|In order to evaluate the contribution of the VDR alleles in bone mass loss, the BsmI, ApaI and TaqI polymorphisms in the VDR gene were studied in 126 postmenopausal women.|It was found that the bb, aa and TT genotypes and the bAT and baT haplotypes were associated with a lower BMD measured at the forearm.|Our analysis reveals a significant association between VDR gene alleles and bone mass in the population studied.

12890547	<TITLE>Effects of hypotonic shock on intracellular pH in bovine articular chondrocytes.</TITLE>Chondrocytes inhabit an unusual environment, in which they are repeatedly subjected to osmotic challenges as fluid is expressed from the extracellular matrix during static joint loading. In the present study, the effects of hypotonic shock on intracellular pH, pH(i), have been studied in isolated bovine articular chondrocytes using the pH-sensitive fluroprobe BCECF. Cells subjected to a 50% dilution rapidly alkalinised, by approximately 0.2 pH units, a sustained plateau being achieved within 300 s. The effect was not altered by inhibitors of pH regulators, such as amiloride, bafilomycin and SITS, but was absent when cells were subjected to hypotonic shocks in solutions in which Na(+) ions were replaced by NMDG(+). The response was found to be sensitive to Gd(3+) ions, blockers of stretch-activated cation channels. Alkalinisation was also inhibited by treatment with Zn(2+) ions, at a concentration reported to block voltage-activated H(+) channels (VAHC). Depolarisation using high K(+) solutions supplemented with valinomycin also induced intracellular alkalinisation. Measurements using a membrane potential (E(m)) fluorescent dye showed that E(m) was approximately -44 mV, but was depolarised by over 50 mV following HTS. The depolarisation was also inhibited by Na(+) substitution with NMDG(+) or treatment with Gd(3+). We conclude that in response to HTS the opening of a stretch-activated cation channel leads to Na(+) influx, which results in a membrane depolarisation. Subsequent activation of VAHC permits H(+) ion efflux along the prevailing electrochemcial gradient, leading to the alkalinisation, which we record.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12902221	<TITLE>Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase promotes nodulation of pea plants.</TITLE>Ethylene inhibits nodulation in various legumes. In order to investigate strategies employed by Rhizobium to regulate nodulation, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase gene was isolated and characterized from one of the ACC deaminase-producing rhizobia, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 128C53K. ACC deaminase degrades ACC, the immediate precursor of ethylene in higher plants. Through the action of this enzyme, ACC deaminase-containing bacteria can reduce ethylene biosynthesis in plants. Insertion mutants with mutations in the rhizobial ACC deaminase gene (acdS) and its regulatory gene, a leucine-responsive regulatory protein-like gene (lrpL), were constructed and tested to determine their abilities to nodulate Pisum sativum L. cv. Sparkle (pea). Both mutants, neither of which synthesized ACC deaminase, showed decreased nodulation efficiency compared to that of the parental strain. Our results suggest that ACC deaminase in R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 128C53K enhances the nodulation of P. sativum L. cv. Sparkle, likely by modulating ethylene levels in the plant roots during the early stages of nodule development. ACC deaminase might be the second described strategy utilized by Rhizobium to promote nodulation by adjusting ethylene levels in legumes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We show that the analogy with a double dot holds down to remarkably low magnetic fields. The analysis is extended by full 3D spin density functional calculations. Introducing an effective Kondo coupling parameter, the chessboard pattern is self-consistently computed as a function of magnetic field and electron number, which enables us to explain our experimental data quantitatively.

12921918	<TITLE>Selegiline in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children: a double blind and randomized trial.</TITLE>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder of childhood that affects 3% to 6% of school-age children. Conventional stimulant medications are recognized by both specialists and parents as useful symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, approximately 30% of ADHD children treated with them do not respond adequately or cannot tolerate the associated adverse effects. Such difficulties highlight the need for alternative safe and effective medications in the treatment of this disorder. Selegiline is a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that is metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine stimulant compounds that may be useful in the treatment of ADHD. The authors undertook this study to further evaluate, under double-blind and controlled conditions, the efficacy of selegiline for ADHD in children. A total of 28 children with ADHD as defined by DSM IV were randomized to selegiline or methylphenidate dosed on an age and weight-adjusted basis at selegiline 5 mg/day (under 5 years) and 10 mg/day (over 5 years) (Group 1) and methylphenidate 1 mg/kg/day (Group 2) for a 4-week double-blind clinical trial. The principal measure of the outcome was the Teacher and Parent ADHD Rating Scale. Patients were assessed by a child psychiatrist at baseline, 14 and 28 days after the medication started. No significant differences were observed between the two protocols on the Parent and Teacher Rating Scale scores. Although the number of dropouts in the methylphenidate group was higher than in the selegiline group, there was no significant difference between the two protocols in terms of the dropouts. Decreased appetite, difficulty falling asleep and headaches were observed more in the methylphenidate group. The results of this study must be considered preliminary, but they do suggest that selegiline may be beneficial in the treatment of ADHD. In addition, a tolerable side effect profile may be considered as one of the advantages of selegiline in the treatment of ADHD.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
12956424	<TITLE>Ovarian cancer cell proliferation and motility is induced by engagement of integrin alpha(v)beta3/Vitronectin interaction.</TITLE>During tumor metastasis, a fine-tuned balance between the formation and loosening of adhesive cell contacts has to occur, a process based on the regulated expression of integrins. Human ovarian OV-MZ-6 cancer cells express the integrin alpha(v)beta3, which associates with vitronectin (VN) and correlates with ovarian cancer progression. Adhesion and spreading of OV-MZ-6 cells on VN was accompanied by the formation of focal adhesion contacts and the recruitment of activated tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase. Cultivation of OV-MZ-6 cells on VN resulted in a significantly induced cell proliferation. This VN effect could be mimicked by cultivating cells on the immobilized alpha(v)beta3 directed peptide cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val (cRGDfV). VN-dependent OV-MZ-6 cell adhesion and proliferation was significantly enhanced by overexpression of alpha(v)beta3 and was accompanied by rapid and transient tyrosine-phosphorylation of p44(erk-1)/p42(erk-2) mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, overexpression of alpha(v)beta3 and OV-MZ-6 cell attachment to VN increased cell motility up to 5-fold accompanied by prominent changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. Upon alpha(v)beta3/VN interaction, by cDNA expression microarray analysis we identified altered mRNA levels of c-myc, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), transcription factor Fra-1, prothymosin-alpha (PTMA), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and the cell adhesion molecule SQM-1, candidates which are possibly involved in changes of the adhesive, migratory, and proliferative phenotype of human ovarian cancer cells.

12959687	<TITLE>Surveillance of pediatric infections in a teaching hospital in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.</TITLE>Nosocomial infections (NI) result in considerably high mortality and morbidity rates, especially among pediatric patients. Considering current worldwide changes, information about the occurrence of pathogens and susceptibility tests are now seen as decisive for optimizing treatment. The purpose of this research was to determine the frequency of microorganisms, antimicrobial and genetic profiles, and risk factors associated with nosocomial infections in a teaching hospital in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. From January 1998 to December 1999, 108 patients were characterized as having nosocomial infection, from which 137 pathogens were isolated. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by conventional and automated techniques. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were characterized by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Pathogens were most often isolated from infants one-month old or younger, and bloodstream infections were the most frequent. The main isolated agents isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (38), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19), S. aureus (26), K. pneumoniae (18), and Candida spp. (13). The risk conditions that were most closely related to NI acquisition were: prolonged hospital stays (69.4%), prematurity (60.9%) and exposure to high-risk device procedures (95.4%). Ciprofloxacin and imipenem were the most effective drugs, inhibiting all or almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus isolates. Only 23% of the S. aureus samples were resistant to oxacillin. Genomic typing revealed 10 distinct patterns for S. aureus and 13 for K. pneumoniae, suggesting that most them did not belong to the same clone. PFGE was effective in differentiating the strains.

MTT cell viability assays were performed at 72 hours post-treatment.|Toxicity to ICG or infrared laser alone was not observed in any of the cell lines. Cell viability assays showed an ICG dose-dependent ablation when combined with laser exposure (+L). In all 3 cancer cell lines, significant growth inhibition was seen at 10 microg/mL ICG + L with nearly total ablation at 20 microg/mL ICG + L (P < 0.01).|ICG PDT induces consistent and dramatic pancreatic cancer cell death. Since neither ICG nor laser alone caused toxicity, combination therapy may offer effective control of tumor growth with minimal side effects in patients with unresectable primary or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

14599273	<TITLE>Line bisection in the split brain.</TITLE>The authors examined line bisection in 4 patients with resection of the corpus callosum and in 22 control participants. The control participants showed a leftward bias, especially with the left hand, implying right-hemispheric dominance in spatial attention. Two patients with anterior callosotomy showed similar biases, suggesting that the anterior callosum plays only a small role. A patient with complete callosotomy showed a strong right bias, regardless of hand use. A patient with posterior callosotomy showed the opposite pattern: a strong left bias, regardless of hand use. These data suggest that the posterior corpus callosum normally plays a role in line bisection and that the resection of the posterior corpus callosum produces consistent bias. The direction of the bias depends on which hemisphere assumes control.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
14623864	<TITLE>Loss of m-AAA protease in mitochondria causes complex I deficiency and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in hereditary spastic paraplegia.</TITLE>Mmutations in paraplegin, a putative mitochondrial metallopeptidase of the AAA family, cause an autosomal recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here, we analyze the function of paraplegin at the cellular level and characterize the phenotypic defects of HSP patients' cells lacking this protein. We demonstrate that paraplegin coassembles with a homologous protein, AFG3L2, in the mitochondrial inner membrane. These two proteins form a high molecular mass complex, which we show to be aberrant in HSP fibroblasts. The loss of this complex causes a reduced complex I activity in mitochondria and an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress, which can both be rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type paraplegin. Furthermore, complementation studies in yeast demonstrate functional conservation of the human paraplegin-AFG3L2 complex with the yeast m-AAA protease and assign proteolytic activity to this structure. These results shed new light on the molecular pathogenesis of HSP and functionally link AFG3L2 to this neurodegenerative disease.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
14636068	<TITLE>Extending recognition by peptide nucleic acids (PNAs): binding to duplex DNA and inhibition of transcription by tail-clamp PNA-peptide conjugates.</TITLE>Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are a powerful tool for recognition of double-stranded DNA. Strand invasion is most efficient when pyrimidine PNAs are linked to form a bisPNA in which one strand binds by Watson-Crick base pairing while the other binds by Hoogsteen base pairing to the newly formed PNA-DNA duplex. Within many genes, however, polypyrimidine target sequences may not be located in optimal positions relative to transcription factor binding sites, and this deficiency may complicate attempts to identify potent antigene PNAs. To increase the versatility of strand invasion by PNAs, we have synthesized bisPNAs and bisPNA-peptide conjugates containing a mixed base extension of the Watson-Crick polypyrimidine strand. We find that these tail-clamp PNAs (TC-PNAs) bind duplex DNA and inhibit transcription. DNA recognition occurs with single-stranded or TC-bisPNAs and requires attachment of positively charged amino acids. Association rate constants, k(a), for binding to DNA by TC-PNAs are as high as 35000 M(-1) s(-1) and are usually only a fewfold lower than for analogous PNAs that lack mixed base extensions. The ability to bind duplex DNA is not always necessary for inhibition of transcription, possibly because PNAs can bind to accessible DNA within the transcription bubble created by RNA polymerase. These results, together with similar findings independently obtained by Nielsen and colleagues [Bentin, T., Larsen, H. J., and Nielsen, P. E. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 13987-13995], expand the range of sequences within duplex DNA that are accessible to PNAs and suggest that TC-PNA-peptide conjugates are good candidates for further testing as antigene agents.

The mean concentration of eotaxin in serum of infected mice gradually increased from 46.3+/-6.5 pg/ml at week 0 to 104.9+/-44.8 pg/ml at week 3 after infection, while the mean eotaxin level in the CSF of infected mice rapidly increased from 18.7+/-2.1 pg/ml to 193.2+/-23.6 pg/ml 1 week after infection and then increased further to 507.8+/-167.9 pg/ml at week 3. The concentrations of eotaxin in the CSF of infected mice each week after infection were all significantly higher than those in serum ( P<0.0001). In parallel with the increase in eotaxin in the CSF, infected mice showed gradual increases in CSF eosinophilia and a reduction in intracranial worm recovery. The concentration of eotaxin in CSF was higher in infected mice with more worms in the brain, except when the number of worms in the brain was >30. In addition, when the worm counts in the brains of infected mice were <30, eotaxin concentrations in the CSF were positively correlated with worm counts in the brain ( P<0.001). Thus, the release of eotaxin in the CSF of mice infected with A. cantonensis observed in this study was time dependent and worm-load dependent, and in parallel with the increase in eotaxin in the CSF, and gradual decreases in worm counts in the brains of infected mice.

14670602	<TITLE>Kinetic analyses of state transitions of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and its mutant strains impaired in electron transport.</TITLE>The state transitions of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and of three mutant strains, which were impaired in PsaE-dependent cyclic electron transport (psaE(-)), respiratory electron transport (ndhF(-)) and both activities (psaE(-)ndhF(-)), were analyzed. Dark incubation of the wild type and psaE(-) cells led to a transition to state 2, while the ndhF(-) strains remained in state 1 after dark incubation. The ndhF(-) cells adapted to state 2 when the cells were incubated under anaerobic conditions or in the presence of potassium cyanide; these results suggest that the ndhF(-) cells were inefficient in performing state 1 to state 2 transitions in the dark unless cytochrome oxidase activity was inhibited. In the state 2 to state 1 transition of wild-type cells induced by light in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), there was still a significant reduction of the interphotosystem electron carriers by both respiration and cyclic electron flow around PSI. Kinetic analysis of the state 2 to state 1 transition shows that, in the absence of PSII activity, the relative contribution to the reduced state of the interphotosystem electron carriers by respiratory and cyclic electron transfer is about 72% and 28%, respectively. The state 2 to state 1 transition was prevented by the cytochrome b(6)f inhibitor 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone (DBMIB). On the other hand, the state 1 to state 2 transition was induced by DBMIB with half times of approximately 8 s in all strains. The externally added electron acceptor 2,5-dimethyl-benzoquinone (DMBQ) induced a state 2 to state 1 transition in the dark and this transition could be prevented by DBMIB. The light-induced oxidation of P700 showed that approximately 50% of PSI could be excited by 630-nm light absorbed by phycobilisomes (PBS) under state 2 conditions. P700 oxidation measurements with light absorbed by PBS also showed that the dark-induced state 1 to state 2 transition occurred in wild-type cells but not in the ndhF(-) cells. The possible mechanism for sensing an imbalanced light regime in cyanobacterial state transitions is discussed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
14751992	<TITLE>Regression trees for regulatory element identification.</TITLE>The transcription of a gene is largely determined by short sequence motifs that serve as binding sites for transcription factors. Recent findings suggest direct relationships between the motifs and gene expression levels. In this work, we present a method for identifying regulatory motifs. Our method makes use of tree-based techniques for recovering the relationships between motifs and gene expression levels.|We treat regulatory motifs and gene expression levels as predictor variables and responses, respectively, and use a regression tree model to identify the structural relationships between them. The regression tree methodology is extended to handle responses from multiple experiments by modifying the split function. The significance of regulatory elements is determined by analyzing tree structures and using a variable importance measure. When applied to two data sets of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the method successfully identifies most of the regulatory motifs that are known to control gene transcription under the given experimental conditions, and suggests several new putative motifs. Analysis of the tree structures also reconfirms several pairs of motifs that are known to regulate gene transcription in combination.|http://if.kaist.ac.kr/~phuong/RegTree	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
14960583	<TITLE>Translational induction of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein HIAP2 during endoplasmic reticulum stress attenuates cell death and is mediated via an inducible internal ribosome entry site element.</TITLE>Prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to activation of caspases and cell death. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are intrinsic inhibitors of apoptosis by virtue of inhibiting distinct caspases and are, therefore, critical regulators of cell death. Here we demonstrate that the expression of one member of the IAP family, HIAP2, is induced in response to ER stress and attenuates ER stress-induced cell death. The induction of HIAP2 is executed at the level of protein synthesis and is mediated by an inducible internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element. The triggering of ER stress results in caspase-mediated proteolytic processing of eukaryotic initiation factor p97/DAP5/NAT1, producing a fragment that specifically activates HIAP2 IRES. These data suggest an existence of a novel mechanism that regulates apoptotic response in ER stress.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We present two patients with Parkinson's disease in whom administration of quetiapine for drug-induced psychosis caused characteristic stereotyped behaviors or punding. Since stereotyped behaviors are usually associated with excessive dopaminergic activity, it is clinically important to note that stereotyped behaviors or punding may be induced by an atypical antipsychotic drug for the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease.

15107465	<TITLE>Properties of switch-like bioregulatory networks studied by simulation of the hypoxia response control system.</TITLE>A complex bioregulatory network could be more easily comprehended if its essential function could be described by a small "core" subsystem, and if its response characteristics were switch-like. We tested this proposition by simulation studies of the hypoxia response control network. We hypothesized that a small subsystem governs the basics of the cellular response to hypoxia and that this response has a sharp oxygen-dependent transition. A molecular interaction map of the network was prepared, and an evolutionarily conserved core subsystem was extracted that could control the activity of hypoxia response promoter elements on the basis of oxygen concentration. The core subsystem included the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIFalpha:ARNT heterodimer), proline hydroxylase, and the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Simulation studies showed that the same core subsystem can exhibit switch-like responses both to oxygen level and to HIFalpha synthesis rate, thus suggesting a mechanism for hypoxia response promoter element-dependent responses common to both hypoxia and growth factor signaling. The studies disclosed the mechanism responsible for the sharp transitions. We show how parameter sets giving switch-like behavior can be found and how this type of behavior provides a foundation for quantitative studies in cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15124084	<TITLE>Alkaloids from Cassytha filiformis and related aporphines: antitrypanosomal activity, cytotoxicity, and interaction with DNA and topoisomerases.</TITLE>Cassytha filiformis (Lauraceae), a widely distributed parasitic plant, contains several aporphine alkaloids and is often used in African folk medicine to treat cancer, African trypanosomiasis and other diseases. In a previous investigation, we showed that the alkaloid plant extract and the isolated aporphines possessed in vitro cytotoxic properties. In this paper, we evaluated the in vitro activity of the alkaloid extract (IC50 = 2.2 microg/mL) and its three major aporphine alkaloids (actinodaphnine, cassythine, and dicentrine) on Trypanosoma brucei brucei as well as four related commercially available aporphines (bulbocapnine, glaucine, isocorydine, boldine). Only the three alkaloids from Cassytha filiformis were active on the trypanosomes in vitro (IC50 = 3-15 microM). Additionally, we compared the cytotoxicity of these seven compounds on HeLa cells. Glaucine was the most cytotoxic compound on HeLa cells (IC50 = 8.2 microM) in the series. In order to elucidate their mechanism of action, the binding mode of these molecules to DNA was studied by UV absorption, circular and linear dichroism spectroscopy. The results of the optical measurements indicated that all seven aporphines effectively bind to DNA and behave as typical intercalating agents. Biochemical experiments showed that actinodaphnine, cassythine and dicentrine also interfere with the catalytic activity of topoisomerases in contrast to the four other aporphines. These interactions with DNA may explain, at least in part, the effects observed on cancer cells and on trypanosomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15199439	<TITLE>Cost-effectiveness analysis of the genetic screening program for familial hypercholesterolemia in The Netherlands.</TITLE>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with pronounced atherosclerosis leading to premature cardiovascular disease and untimely death. Despite the availability of effective preventative drug treatments, many affected individuals remain undiagnosed and untreated until they become symptomatic with cardiovascular disease. To assess the cost-effectiveness of systematic genetic screening of family members of persons diagnosed with FH, an analysis was conducted using data from a nationwide screening program for the identification of individuals with FH, instituted in The Netherlands in 1994, and from other sources. There was DNA testing of families with a known genetic defect to identify new cases of FH in the presymptomatic stage of the disease. After identification, most newly identified patients were started on cholesterol-lowering statin treatment. On average, new cases diagnosed by the screening program gained 3.3 years of life each. Twenty-six myocardial infarctions would be avoided for every 100 persons treated with statins between the ages of 18 and 60 years. The average total lifetime incremental costs, over all age ranges and both sexes, including costs for screening and testing, lifetime drug treatment, and treatment of cardiovascular events, was US dollars 7500 per new case identified. Cost per life-year gained was US dollars 8700. Therefore, systematic genetic screening of family members of persons diagnosed with FH is cost-effective in The Netherlands and should be considered for other settings.

15251253	<TITLE>Anxiolytic effects of diazepam and ethanol in two behavioral models: comparison of males and females.</TITLE>The present study compared the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam and ethanol in adult male and female rats. Varying doses of diazepam (1-3 mg/kg) or ethanol (0.5-2.0 g/kg) were tested using both the elevated plus maze and defensive prod-burying models. Two time points following ethanol administration (10 and 30 min) were tested in the plus maze. Sex differences were seen in some anxiety-related behaviors, with females showing greater open arm time and reduced burying behavior than males. Although this suggests females displayed less anxiety-like behavior than males, the differences in the plus maze were not observed in all testing situations. Both diazepam and ethanol dose-dependently increased open arm times in the plus maze and reduced burying behavior in the defensive prod-burying task. The parallel nature of the dose-response curves suggests that both diazepam and ethanol have similar anxiolytic effects in males and females. No sex differences were seen in the brain levels of diazepam-like activity or blood alcohol levels with these treatments. A greater corticosterone response was observed in females than males with these two behavioral tests, but neither diazepam nor ethanol decreased this response. These results suggest a dissociation between the anxiety-reducing influences of these compounds and the changes in stress-related endocrine responses.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15261741	<TITLE>Testicular interstitial cells, and steroidogenic detection in the protogynous fish, Synbranchus marmoratus (Teleostei, Synbranchidae).</TITLE>The swamp eel, Synbranchus marmoratus, is a freshwater protogynic diandric species. Primary males develop directly as males while secondary males arise from the sex reversal of females. Fishes from Argentine and Brazil inland waters were collected, examined and compared for this study. In order to characterize the interstitial testicular compartment, light and electron microscopy techniques and an enzyme histochemical examination for steroidogenic cells detection were used. The interstitial compartment of S. marmoratus is composed of Leydig and myoid cells, collagen fibers, blood cells, macrophages,and amyelinic nerves. At the ultrastructural level, no differences were observed in the interstitial tissue, either between specimens from the different sampling sites or between primary and secondary males. Leydig cells are present in all testes examined throughout the year. A cytoplasmatic reaction of 3beta-HSD was detected only in Leydig cells during sex reversal and in both type of males, mainly during the regressed and early maturation classes (autumn and winter). Leydig cells possess the typical fine structural characteristics associated with steroidogenesis. Furthermore, in both type of males, during sex reversal and after the spawning period, the number of granulocytes and macrophages present in the testes increased, suggesting that they could be involved in phagocytosis and resorption of damaged cells.

15262814	<TITLE>Tracking repeats using significance and transitivity.</TITLE>Internal repeats in coding sequences correspond to structural and functional units of proteins. Moreover, duplication of fragments of coding sequences is known to be a mechanism to facilitate evolution. Identification of repeats is crucial to shed light on the function and structure of proteins, and explain their evolutionary past. The task is difficult because during the course of evolution many repeats diverged beyond recognition.|We introduce a new method TRUST, for ab initio determination of internal repeats in proteins. It provides an improvement in prediction quality as compared to alternative state-of-the-art methods. The increased sensitivity and accuracy of the method is achieved by exploiting the concept of transitivity of alignments. Starting from significant local suboptimal alignments, the application of transitivity allows us to (1) identify distant repeat homologues for which no alignments were found; (2) gain confidence about consistently well-aligned regions; and (3) recognize and reduce the contribution of non-homologous repeats. This re-assessment step enables us to derive a virtually noise-free profile representing a generalized repeat with high fidelity. We also obtained superior specificity by employing rigid statistical testing for self-sequence and profile-sequence alignments. Assessment was done using a database of repeat annotations based on structural superpositioning. The results show that TRUST is a useful and reliable tool for mining tandem and non-tandem repeats in protein sequence databases, capable of predicting multiple repeat types with varying intervening segments within a single sequence.|The TRUST server (together with the source code) is available at http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/programs/trustwww	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15350197	<TITLE>Determination of the differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments using local FDR.</TITLE>Thousands of genes in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, for detecting differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. The expected proportion of false positive genes in a set of genes, called the False Discovery Rate (FDR), has been proposed to measure the statistical significance of this set. Various procedures exist for controlling the FDR. However the threshold (generally 5%) is arbitrary and a specific measure associated with each gene would be worthwhile.|Using process intensity estimation methods, we define and give estimates of the local FDR, which may be considered as the probability for a gene to be a false positive. After a global assessment rule controlling the false positive error, the local FDR is a valuable guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed. The interest of the method is illustrated on three well known data sets. A R routine for computing local FDR estimates from p-values is available at http://www.inapg.fr/ens_rech/mathinfo/recherche/mathematique/outil.html.|The local FDR associated with each gene measures the probability that it is a false positive. It gives the opportunity to compute the FDR of any given group of clones (of the same gene) or genes pertaining to the same regulation network or the same chromosomic region.

15369763	<TITLE>Spliceosome Sm proteins D1, D3, and B/B' are asymmetrically dimethylated at arginine residues in the nucleus.</TITLE>We report a novel modification of spliceosome proteins Sm D1, Sm D3, and Sm B/B'. L292 mouse fibroblasts were labeled in vivo with [3H]methionine. Sm D1, Sm D3, and Sm B/B' were purified from either nuclear extracts, cytosolic extracts or a cytosolic 6S complex by immunoprecipitation of the Sm protein-containing complexes and then separation by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel containing urea. The isolated Sm D1, Sm D3 or Sm B/B' proteins were hydrolyzed to amino acids and the products were analyzed by high-resolution cation exchange chromatography. Sm D1, Sm D3, and Sm B/B' isolated from nuclear fractions were all found to contain omega-NG-monomethylarginine and symmetric omega-NG,NG'-dimethylarginine, modifications that have been previously described. In addition, Sm D1, Sm D3, and Sm B/B' were also found to contain asymmetric omega-NG,NG-dimethylarginine in these nuclear fractions. Analysis of Sm B/B' from cytosolic fractions and Sm B/B' and Sm D1 from cytosolic 6S complexes showed only the presence of omega-NG-monomethylarginine and symmetric omega-NG,NG'-dimethylarginine. These results indicate that Sm D1, Sm D3, and Sm B/B' are asymmetrically dimethylated and that these modified proteins are located in the nucleus. In reactions in which Sm D1 or Sm D3 was methylated in vitro with a hemagglutinin-tagged PRMT5 purified from HeLa cells, we detected both symmetric omega-NG,NG'-dimethylarginine and asymmetric omega-NG,NG-dimethylarginine when reactions were done in a Tris/HCl buffer, but only detected symmetric omega-NG,NG'-dimethylarginine when a sodium phosphate buffer was used. These results suggest that the activity responsible for the formation of asymmetric dimethylated arginine residues in Sm proteins is either PRMT5 or a protein associated with it in the immunoprecipitated complex.

15375755	<TITLE>Cytoskeleton disruption in chondrocytes from a rat osteoarthrosic (OA) -induced model: its potential role in OA pathogenesis.</TITLE>Morphological and functional changes of chondrocytes are typical in OA cartilage. In this work, we have described noteworthy changes in intermediate filaments cytoskeleton evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. Alterations in the distribution as well as in the content of vimentin, actin, and tubulin have been described by specific fluorescence labelling of each cytoskeletal component and confocal analysis. Normal vs OA cartilages showed a reduction in the percentage of labelled chondrocytes of 37.1% for vimentin, 4.7% for actin, and 20.1% for tubulin. Statistical analysis of fluorescence intensities (mean % +/- SEM) between normal and OA rat cartilage revealed a highly significant difference in vimentin, a significant difference in tubulin, and a non-significant difference in actin. Moreover, by western blot, altered electrophoretic patterns were observed mainly for vimentin and tubulin in OA cartilage in comparison with normal cartilage. These results allow us to suggest that substantial changes in vimentin and tubulin cytoskeleton of chondrocytes might be involved in OA pathogenesis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

15478944	<TITLE>Flunarizine: a possible adjuvant medication against soman poisoning?</TITLE>Organophosphate (OP) nerve agents are amongst the most toxic chemicals. One of them, soman, can induce severe epileptic seizures and brain damage for which therapy is incomplete. The present study shows that pretreatment with flunarizine (Flu), a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker, when used alone, does not produce any beneficial effect against the convulsions, neuropathology and lethality induced by soman. Flu was also tested in combination with atropine sulfate and diazepam. In this case, although only some results reach statistical significance, an encouraging general trend toward an improvement of the anticonvulsant, neuroprotective and antilethal capacities of this classical anti-OP two-drug regimen is constantly observed. In the light of these findings, it seems premature to definitely reject (or recommend) Flu as a possible adjuvant medication against soman poisoning. Further studies are required to determine its real potential interest.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Final items were generated by score results, elimination of redundancies, and content review. Resulting high-effect areas were queried for validation with a 7-point Likert scale. A final instrument including 17 items and 2 expectation of outcome questions was distributed to 352 families for validation.|Areas of effect included family/social activities (restaurant meals, social activities, child care, vacation), school, time for meal preparation, health concerns, and emotional issues. Validation steps showed strong internal validity (Cronbach alpha, 0.95) and good correlation with expectation of outcome questions ( r = 0.412; P < .01) and scores on a generic HRQL instrument, the Children's Health Questionnaire-PF50 ( r = -0.36 to -0.4; P < .01). The instrument showed the ability to discriminate by disease burden: parents whose children had multiple (>2) food allergies were more affected than parents whose children had fewer allergies (scores, 3.1 vs 2.6; P < .001).|The Food Allergy Quality of Life-Parental Burden demonstrates strong internal and cross-sectional validity.

15631497	<TITLE>Supramolecular helical mesomorphic polymers. Chiral induction through H-bonding.</TITLE>The work described here concerns a challenge of general interest in supramolecular chemistry: the achievement of chiral helical organizations with controlled structures. This work provides a strategy to obtain supramolecular polymers in which a chiral helical conformation has been induced by a noncovalent association, that is, through hydrogen bonding. Polycatenar 2,4,6-triarylamino-1,3,5-triazines, which organize into columnar mesophases and are susceptible to H-bonding interactions, were chosen as a starting point to build up the chiral supramolecular structure. The stacking of these mesogens has been forced to wind in a helical way by means of H-bond association with (R)-3-methyladipic acid, within the mesophase. The optically active columnar organization has been studied in depth by optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction, and circular dichroism. Formation of stable complexes between the triazine units and (R)-3-methyladipic acid has also been investigated by means of NMR diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments in chloroform.

15641807	<TITLE>Interplay of flexibility and stability in the control of estrogen receptor activity.</TITLE>Previously, we have identified an imperfect estrogen response element (rtERE) in the promoter of the rainbow trout vitellogenin gene. Although this ERE leads to a lower transcriptional activation, a better estradiol stimulation in vivo as compared to consensus ERE (EREcs) was observed. Here we examine the ability of recombinant human estrogen receptor alpha (rhERalpha) to bind DNA containing the EREcs or the natural imperfect rtERE, which contains three mismatches. At low salt concentration, whatever the ERE sequence, dissociation equilibrium constants of the specific rhERalpha-ERE complexes are similar (K(D) = 2 nM) with the same stoichiometry. As salt concentration increases from 80 to 200 mM KCl, the affinity of the rhERalpha-rtERE complex largely diminishes whereas that of rhERalpha-EREcs seems less affected. Hence the nature of the interactions stabilizing these complexes is different: more ionic in rhERalpha-rtERE as compared to rhERalpha-EREcs. Moreover, kinetic measurements showed that specific rhERalpha-ERE complexes exhibit shorter half-lives (few seconds) and that the rhERalpha-EREcs complex is more stable (33 s) than the complex that formed with rtERE (19.8 s), in accordance with equilibrium binding results. Finally, dynamic studies of rhERalpha have shown that the protein fluctuations are damped when the salt concentration increases or when bound to ERE and all the more with rtERE. The interplay of affinity, complex half-lives, and protein dynamics in the transcriptional regulation of estrogen receptor is discussed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15672132	<TITLE>Acoustic micromachining of three-dimensional surfaces for biological applications.</TITLE>We present the use of an accessible micromachining technique (acoustic micromachining) for manufacturing micron-feature surfaces with non-discretely varying depth. Acoustic micromachining allows for non-photolithographic production of metal templates with programmable spatial patterns and involves the use of standard acoustic, cutting and electroplating equipment for mass production of vinyl records. Simple 3D patterns were transferred from an acoustic signal into working nickel templates, from which elastic polymer molds were obtained, featuring deep surface grooves and non-discrete (smooth) variations in the z-dimension. Versatility and applicability of the method is demonstrated in obtaining microfluidics structures, manufacturing high-surface area wavy polymer fibers, assembly of cell networks on scaffolds with 3D topography, and microcontact printing of proteins and cells.

15755726	<TITLE>Structure and kinetics of a monomeric glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase: missing link of the NagB superfamily?</TITLE>Glucosamine 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate and ammonia by the action of the enzyme glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase, NagB. This reaction is the final step in the specific GlcNAc utilization pathway and thus decides the metabolic fate of GlcNAc. Sequence analyses suggest that the NagB "superfamily" consists of three main clusters: multimeric and allosterically regulated glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminases (exemplified by Escherichia coli NagB), phosphogluconolactonases, and monomeric hexosamine-6-phosphate deaminases. Here we present the three-dimensional structure and kinetics of the first member of this latter group, the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase, NagB, from Bacillus subtilis. The structures were determined in ligand-complexed forms at resolutions around 1.4 Angstroms. BsuNagB is monomeric in solution and as a consequence is active (k(cat) 28 s(-1), K(m(app)) 0.13 mM) without the need for allosteric activators. A decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations may reflect substrate inhibition (with K(i) of approximately 4 mM). The structure completes the NagB superfamily structural landscape and thus allows further interrogation of genomic data in terms of the regulation of NagB and the metabolic fate(s) of glucosamine 6-phosphate.

15777733	<TITLE>Model of transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1-NBR2 bi-directional transcriptional unit.</TITLE>In contrast to hundreds of mutations found in familial breast and/or ovarian cancers, somatic mutations of BRCA1 are very rare. However, a high percentage of sporadic breast and ovarian cancers show a reduction in BRCA1 expression, suggesting that defects in transcriptional regulation is a contributing factor. BRCA1 shares a promoter with its neighboring gene, NBR2, which is transcribed in the opposite direction. We have previously shown that the transcription of BRCA1 is negatively regulated by protein factors that interact with a 36-bp segment, located 575 bp into its first intron. We now report the localization of an 18-bp transcriptional repressor element for NBR2, which resides 948 bp into its first intron. The binding of nuclear proteins to this repressor element was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and it conferred an orientation-dependent functional suppression onto a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Combined with our previous studies, a model of transcriptional regulation of the closely aligned BRCA1-NBR2 bi-directional unit is proposed. A minimal 56-bp DNA region is functional in driving transcription in both directions, while uni-directional control is provided by distinct repressors that bind to sequences located in the first intron of the respective genes.

We studied a murine model of AIDS, the CD4C/HIV transgenic (Tg) mouse model, to assess the importance of the apoptotic pathway in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis. In these Tg mice, Nef is the major determinant of the disease and is expressed in immature and mature CD4(+) T cells and in cells of the macrophage/myeloid lineage. We report here a novel AIDS-like phenotype: enhanced death, most likely by apoptosis (as assessed by 7-aminoactinomycin D and annexin V/propidium iodide staining), of Tg thymic and peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also more susceptible to cell death after activation in vitro in mixed lymph node (LN) cultures. However, activation-induced cell death was not higher in Tg than in non-Tg-purified CD4(+) T cells. In addition, expression of Fas and FasL, assessed by flow cytometry, was increased in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from Tg mice compared to that of non-Tg littermates. Despite the enhanced expression of Fas and FasL on Tg CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Fas (lpr/lpr) and FasL (gld/gld) mutant CD4C/HIV Tg mice developed an AIDS-like disease indistinguishable from lpr/+ and gld/+ CD4C/HIV Tg mice, including loss of CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, CD4C/HIV Tg mice homozygous for mutations of two other genes implicated in cell death (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme [ICE], tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [TNFR-1]) developed similar AIDS-like disease as their respective heterozygous controls. Moreover, the double-Tg mice from a cross between the Bcl2/Wehi25 and CD4C/HIV Tg mice showed no major protection against disease. These results represent genetic evidence for the dispensable role of Fas, FasL, ICE, and TNFR-1 on the development of both T-cell loss and organ disease of these Tg mice. They also provide compelling evidence on the lack of protection by Bcl2 against Tg CD4(+)-T-cell death. In view of the high resemblance between numerous phenotypes observed in the CD4C/HIV Tg mice and in human AIDS, our findings are likely to be relevant for the human disease.

A few data from previous studies suggest that the prevalence of LBP is rather lower in developing countries compared with developed countries.|A total of 100 clusters of households (3,215 residents aged 16 years or older) in municipality area of Antalya was selected by systematic sampling. Of these, 3,173 study participants agreed to interview. The response rate was 98.7%.|The crude lifetime, 12-month, and point prevalences of LBP were 46.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44.9-48.3), 35.9% (95% CI, 34.2-37.6), and 20.1% (95% CI, 18.7-21.5), respectively. In logistic regression analysis, age of 36 years or older, female sex, multiparity, being a housewife, being from East Turkey, and smoking showed independent associations with having current LBP. Being religious, heavy smoking, and age 26 to 45 years were associated with having restricted activity related to LBP.|In comparison with other developing countries, point prevalence of LBP is higher in Turkey and approximates to prevalence estimates of LBP in developed countries. Smoking may be associated with both occurrence and severity of LBP. Although piety is not associated with having LBP, religious people are more likely to have restricted activity related to LBP.

We asked: is the inhibition associated with a reduction of colonic inflammation and an increase in colonic cell permeability? Twenty-eight, male F 344 rats were divided into two groups, 10 control animals and 18 animals initiated with azoxymethane. Nine of the rats in the carcinogen-initiated group were given a diet with 5% PEG 8000 in an AIN-93 based, high fat diet. The other nine, and the control group received the diet without the addition of PEG. Nine weeks later, the rats receiving the diet containing PEG had a 43% reduction in ACF (P<0.001) compared with the carcinogen-initiated rats on the control diet, a result confirming earlier observations that PEG inhibits colon carcinogenesis. The animals receiving the diet containing PEG also had a 10-fold reduction in fecal granulocyte marker protein (GMP) (P<0.001) compared with both the carcinogen-treated and the control animals. PEG reduced inflammation below the levels of carcinogen-treated and of untreated animals. Fecal water from the rats receiving PEG did not reduce transepithelial resistance of, or manitol flux through, human Caco-cells grown as monolayers in vitro. PEG may reduce colon carcinogenesis through a mechanism involving colonic inflammation.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Application of TEA, a potassium channel blocker, increased the amplitude of oscillatory currents by >70% but reduced their frequency by approximately 17%. The TEA effects did not appear to result from direct actions on starburst cells, but rather a modulation of their synaptic inputs. Oscillatory currents were inhibited by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione (CNQX), an antagonist of AMPA/kainate receptors, indicating that they were dependent on a periodic glutamatergic input likely from presynaptic bipolar cells. The oscillations were also inhibited by the calcium channel blockers cadmium and nifedipine, suggesting that the glutamate release was calcium dependent. Application of AP4, an agonist of mGluR6 receptors on on-center bipolar cells, blocked the oscillatory currents in starburst cells. However, application of TEA overcame the AP4 blockade, suggesting that the periodic glutamate release from bipolar cells is intrinsic to the inner plexiform layer in that, under experimental conditions, it can occur independent of photoreceptor input. The GABA receptor antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline enhanced the amplitude of oscillations in starburst cells prestimulated with TEA. Our results suggest that this enhancement was due to a reduction of a GABAergic feedback inhibition from amacrine cells to bipolar cells and the resultant increased glutamate release. Finally, we found that some ganglion cells and other types of amacrine cell also displayed rhythmic activity, suggesting that oscillatory behavior is expressed by a number of inner retinal neurons.

15939222	<TITLE>Pain patients in a randomized trial did not show a significant effect of a positive consultation.</TITLE>To examine whether telling symptomatic patients that they will soon be better shortens the duration of their illness.|We repeated an earlier trial in general practice on this subject. All our patients were reassured that they probably had no serious underlying disease. We randomized 128 patients into two groups. Half of them got a clear diagnosis and were told that they would soon be better. The others heard from their general practitioners (GPs) that they probably had no serious underlying disease but that the GP did not know exactly what was wrong; these patients were advised to come back later if necessary. For 78 patients, study protocol was followed exactly.|Our trial could not show an effect. The Kaplan-Meier curves of patients with a positive and negative consultation ran nearly parallel. The hazard ratio in the total group was 0.97 (95% precision interval PI=0.69-1.41) and in the optimal subgroup 0.91 (95% PI=0.57-1.46). We still cannot rule out a modest placebo effect.|Our finding contrasts with that of the earlier trial. We think that symptomatic patients mainly want to know that they do not have a serious problem. Often, they will miss the extra information that they get--and then they certainly cannot benefit from it.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
15977302	<TITLE>Small-sample performance of the robust score test and its modifications in generalized estimating equations.</TITLE>The sandwich variance estimator of generalized estimating equations (GEE) may not perform well when the number of independent clusters is small. This could jeopardize the validity of the robust Wald test by causing inflated type I error and lower coverage probability of the corresponding confidence interval than the nominal level. Here, we investigate the small-sample performance of the robust score test for correlated data and propose several modifications to improve the performance. In a simulation study, we compare the robust score test to the robust Wald test for correlated Bernoulli and Poisson data, respectively. It is confirmed that the robust Wald test is too liberal whereas the robust score test is too conservative for small samples. To explain this puzzling operating difference between the two tests, we consider their applications to two special cases, one-sample and two-sample comparisons, thus motivating some modifications to the robust score test. A modification based on a simple adjustment to the usual robust score statistic by a factor of J/(J - 1) (where J is the number of clusters) reduces the conservativeness of the generalized score test. Simulation studies mimicking group-randomized clinical trials with binary and count responses indicated that it may improve the small-sample performance over that of the generalized score and Wald tests with test size closer to the nominal level. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our proposal by applying it to a group-randomized clinical trial, trying alternative cafeteria options in schools (TACOS).

15995417	<TITLE>The role of autologous chondrocyte implantation in the patellofemoral joint.</TITLE>In a prospective study to determine the clinical effectiveness of autologous chondrocyte implantation, 45 patients reached a minimum followup of 2 years (range, 2-7 years; average, 46.4 months) after treatment involving the patellofemoral articulation. There were 28 men (61%) and 17 women (39%) and the average age of the patients was 37.5 years (range, 15-55 years). The treatment groups included (I) isolated patella, n = 8; (II) isolated trochlea, n = 9; (III) patella plus trochlea, n = 4; (IV) weightbearing condyle plus patella n = 2; (V) weightbearing condyle plus trochlea, n = 2; and (VI) weightbearing condyle plus patella plus trochlea n = 20. The average surface area per patella (n = 34) was 4.86 cm2 and per trochlea (n = 34) it was 5.22 cm2. The average resurfacing per knee (n = 45) was 10.45 cm2. We showed a postoperative improvement in quality of life as measured by the Short Form-36; Western Ontario and McMaster University Score, Knee Society Score, modified Cincinnati Score, and a patient satisfaction survey. There were eight failures (18%) as a result of a patella or trochlea failure. Seventy-one percent of patients rated their outcomes as good or excellent, 22% rated outcome as fair, and 7% rated outcome as poor.|Therapeutic Study, Level II-1 (prospective cohort study).

16019302	<TITLE>Atypically high insulin responses to some foods relate to sugars and satiety.</TITLE>Much research has focused on how the glycemic index (GI) of the diets of healthy people relates to long-term risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Low-GI diets appear to produce some of their beneficial effects largely by moderating insulinemic responses to meals. Wolever and Bolognesi (1996) have derived a formula for predicting the insulinemic index (II) from the GI for starchy foods. Using data from Holt et al. (1995, 1997) on a wide variety of common foods, we have examined differences between the observed II and GI-based estimates of the II. These differences were found to correlate negatively with satiety index ratings and positively with contents of total sugars. We suggest that the aforementioned method of measuring and expressing the relation between the GI and the II may prove useful in exploring how various components and sensory properties of food may affect hunger and energy intake.

16036154	<TITLE>Outflow protection filters during percutaneous recanalization of lower extremities' arterial occlusions: a pilot study.</TITLE>Filter devices are already employed for the protection of carotid, coronary and renal distal vascular bed during endovascular procedures. This is a pilot study investigating their feasibility, safety and distal emboli protection capability during recanalization of lower extremities' acute and subacute occlusions.|Study population included 16 patients, 11 with a subacute arterial occlusion and 5 with an acute episode. The Trap filter (Microvena, USA) and its successor the Spider filter (EV3, USA) were utilized. Subacute occlusions were dealt with standard angioplasty and stenting procedures, while acute ones were managed primarily with Angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy. Outflow arterial tree was checked angiographically in-between consequent procedural steps. Embolic material collected after filter recovery was analyzed histopathologically. Patients' follow-up was scheduled at 1 month.|Seventeen filter baskets were applied in the recanalization of 16 target lesions in total. Mean length of the occluded segments was 6.1 (range: 2-15 cm; S.D. = 3.7 cm). Mean in situ time of the filters was 38.75 min (range: 20-60 min; S.D. = 12.71 min). Technical success rate of deployment and utilization of the filtration devices was 100% (17/17). Procedural success rate of the recanalization was 100% (16/16) without any clinical or angiographic evidence of periprocedural distal embolization. Macroscopic particulate debris was extracted from all the filters (17/17) containing fresh thrombus, calcification minerals, cholesterol and fibrin. Mean diameter of the largest particle per specimen was 1702.80 (range: 373.20-4680.00 microm; S.D. = 1155.12 microm). No adverse clinical events occurred at 1-month follow-up with 100% limb salvage (16/16).|The application of outflow protection filters is safe, feasible and efficacious in hindering distal embolization complications and safeguarding the distal capillary bed. Nevertheless, this is a pilot study in a limited group. Further studies have to be contacted in order to provide evidence for a more general use of these devices.

In particular, we solve the critical condition for systems of units operating according to canalizing functions and present strong numerical evidence that our approach correctly predicts the phase transition from order to chaos in such systems.

16163090	<TITLE>Promoting primary healing after ray amputations in the diabetic foot: the plantar dermo-fat pad flap.</TITLE>Amputation of the toe at the level of the distal metatarsal head (ray amputation) is a common surgical procedure in diabetic foot ulcers. The aim of this study was to introduce a new technique promoting primary healing by minimizing the dead space with the plantar dermo-fat pad flap after central ray amputation in diabetic foot ulcers.|Thirty-eight patients who had undergone central ray amputation and closure with the plantar dermo-fat pad flap between 1996 and 2003 were incorporated into the study.|The mean follow-up period was 3.56 years. Single and multiple middle toe amputations were performed in 33 and five cases, respectively. In 14 cases with acute infection, split-thickness skin graft was used with the plantar dermo-fat pad flap to close the defect on the foot dorsum. Healing time was uneventful in all patients except three (8 percent), who were healed with local wound care. No patient showed signs of ulceration at the operative site during the follow-up. The mean time to total healing was 40.31 +/- 34.56 days.|The plantar dermo-fat pad flap promotes primary wound healing after central ray amputation in diabetic foot ulcers by filling the dead space. The osteotomy to the base of the remaining adjacent metatarsal base in an effort to close the defect can be avoided by using the plantar dermo-fat pad flap; thus, undesirable angulation of the remaining parts of the foot can be eliminated. The plantar dermo-fat pad flap also supports the weak articular capsule of the adjacent metatarsophalangeal joints while covering the amputated metatarsal end. The thick, healthy plantar soft tissue advanced up to the width of the deepithelialized area reestablishes a good, tough plantar surface which--in association with the pad effect of the flap--decreases the recurrence rates and provides comfortable ambulation.

16170795	<TITLE>Unconventional method based on circular dichroism to detect peanut DNA in food by means of a PNA probe and a cyanine dye.</TITLE>In this paper we report an innovative and unconventional method based on circular dichroism for the identification of peanut DNA in food, which can be detected after PCR amplification at the nanomolar level by using an achiral PNA probe complementary to a tract of the peanut Ara h 2 gene and an achiral 3,3'-diethylthiadicarbocyanine dye [DiSC(2)(5)]. Peanuts are one of the most common causes of severe allergic reactions to foods and are particularly dangerous when they are "hidden" (undeclared) in food. For better protection of consumers, detection methods are required to specifically detect the presence of hidden allergens in a wide variety of food items. Alternative to the detection of the proteins is the determination of species-specific DNA, which is more resistant to technological treatments. PNAs are very specific probes able to recognize DNA sequences with high affinity and evidence for the binding can be obtained by using the DiSC(2)(5) dye, which aggregates onto the PNA-DNA duplex giving rise to a characteristic visibile band at 540 nm. Because the PNA-DNA duplex is in a right-handed helical conformation, the aggregation of the dye to the duplex gives also rise to a strong CD signal in the 500-600 nm region with a strong exciton coupling due to the formation of multimeric species, since the handedness of the helix is transferred to the dye aggregate. The dye does not interact with the free single-stranded DNA and although aggregating on the achiral PNA, this interaction is obviously not detectable by circular dichroism. Thus, only the formation of the PNA-DNA duplex, which takes place only upon specific Watson-Crick hydrogen binding between the PNA and the DNA bases, is detected, ensuring a very high specificity and sensitivity. The method has been optimized in a model system by using a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the PNA probe, showing that the intensity of the signal is linearly related to the amount of the DNA. The optimized method has been applied to the identification and quantitation of DNA extracted and amplified by PCR from peanuts and from peanut-containing foods, allowing for a very sensitive detection at a very low level (few pmol).

16217709	<TITLE>Marchiafava-Bignami-like injury of the corpus callosum in an infant.</TITLE>We report on a 16-month-old boy who presented with truncal ataxia and intermittent nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 19 months showed a T (2)-hyperintensity of the splenium and the genu of the corpus callosum with extension into the adjacent frontal white matter. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed a corresponding area of restricted diffusion, suggesting cytotoxic oedema. The extent and localisation of the signal abnormalities mimic tissue injury as seen in Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD). Metabolic investigations were normal. Follow-up imaging at 24 months showed a similar T (2)-hyperintensity of the corpus callosum and white matter while on DTI the cytotoxic oedema had resolved. Clinically a remaining truncal and gait ataxia, clumsiness and a developmental delay is seen. Goal of this case report is (a) to present a rare case of Marchiafava-Bignami-like injury of the corpus callosum in an infant and (b) to discuss the neuroradiological imaging findings including MRI and DTI.

16282586	<TITLE>A coarse graining approach to determine nucleic acid structures from small angle neutron scattering profiles in solution.</TITLE>We present a theoretical method to calculate the small angle neutron scattering profile of nucleic acid structures in solution. Our approach is sensitive to the sequence and the structure of the nucleic acid. In order to test our approach, we apply this method to the calculation of the experimental scattered intensity of the decamer d(CCAACGTTGG)2 in H2O. This sequence was specifically chosen for this study as it is believed to adopt a canonical B-form structure in 0.3 M NaCl. We find that not only will our methodology reproduce the experimental scattered intensity for this sequence, but our method will also discriminate between B-, A- and Z-form DNA. By studying the scattering profile of this structure in 0.5 and 1.0 M NaCl, we are also able to identify tetraplex and other similar oligomers formation and to model the complex using the experimental scattering data in conjunction with our methodology.

16284839	<TITLE>Contribution to the study of the chemical composition of Verticillium albo-atrum secretions in liquid media.</TITLE>Verticillium albo-atrum culture filtrates contain numerous metabolites such as enzymes and toxins. Their purification was carried out by high phase liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this study, we set out to look for other lighter metabolites that could be identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses revealed the presence of many volatile chemical compounds, some of which are of great economic interest such as methyl paraben, propyl paraben tethane and xylene. Verticillium albo-atrum, which is a pathogen of many market-garden and fodder crops, is able to produce substances that can be used in both the agro-food and cosmetic industries.

16289580	<TITLE>Optimal harvesting and optimal vaccination.</TITLE>Two optimization problems are considered: Harvesting from a structured population with maximal gain subject to the condition of non-extinction, and vaccinating a population with prescribed reduction of the reproduction number of the disease at minimal costs. It is shown that these problems have a similar structure and can be treated by the same mathematical approach. The optimal solutions have a 'two-window' structure: Optimal harvesting and vaccination strategies or policies are concentrated on one or two preferred age classes. The results are first shown for a linear age structure problem and for an epidemic situation at the uninfected state (minimize costs for a given reduction of the reproduction number) and then extended to populations structured by size, to harvesting at Gurtin-MacCamy equilibria and to vaccination at infected equilibria.

Its treatment is based on a probabilistic antibiotic therapy.|To determine the prevalence of different bacteria responsible for AOM in children in Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire).|This is a prospective study, between November 2002 and August 2003. To identify bacterial isolates, 60 children under 15 years old with AOM were enrolled. In 52 cases, the sample was recovered by aspiration of a spontaneous otorrhea and in eight cases, it was taken by paracentesis. Nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on isolates.|75% of children were under 24 months of age. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 31.8% of cases followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (21%), Proteus (7.4%) and Staphylococcus (6.2%). The rate of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (NSSP) was 11.8%. Resistance to erythromycin was 6%. For Pseudomonas, resistances to antibiotics were 35.5% to ceftazidim and 16% to pefloxacin, respectively, but all the strains were sensible to colistin, iminepem and ciprofloxacin.|These data can modify therapeutic approaches for treatment of AOM in our country.

16321657	<TITLE>C/EBP and Cdx family factors regulate liver fatty acid binding protein transgene expression in the small intestinal epithelium.</TITLE>A transgene constructed from the rat liver fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabp1) promoter is active in all murine small intestinal crypt and villus epithelial cells. Coincident Cdx and C/EBP transcription factor binding sites were identified spanning Fabp1 nucleotides -90 to -78. CDX-1, CDX-2, C/EBPalpha, and C/EBPbeta activated the Fabp1 transgene in CaCo-2 cells, and mutagenizing the -78 site prevented activation by these factors. CDX but not C/EBP factors bound to the site in vitro, although C/EBP factors competed with CDX factors for transgene activation. The -78 site adjoins an HNF-1 site, and CDX and C/EBP family factors cooperated with HNF-1alpha but not HNF-1beta to activate the transgene. Furthermore, CDX-1, CDX-2, C/EBPalpha, and C/EBPbeta bound to HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta. The transgene with a mutagenized -78 site was silenced in vivo specifically in small intestinal crypt epithelial cells but remained active in villus cells. These results demonstrate functional interactions between HNF-1, C/EBP, and CDX family factors and suggest that these interactions may contribute to differential transcriptional regulation in the small intestinal crypt and villus compartments.

16370906	<TITLE>Where's the beef? Putting personality back into personality assessment.</TITLE>This article attempts to demonstrate the value of using a psychoanalytic theory of personality for psychological testing. This approach has more clinical utility than a solely research-based one. It recasts test data into conceptually related constructs that have internal consistency to each other and are directly relevant to psychotherapeutic treatment. Such theoretical recasting serves an organizing function, an integrative function, a clarification function, and a predictive function for the clinical inference process. Furthermore, a psychoanalytically oriented approach to testing allows for the expansion in sources of data that one considers in the testing situation. Five different sources of data emerge from the testing situation once one refocuses on theoretical constructs rather than test signs. These include test scores, test content, the patient-examiner interaction, patient behavior, and examiner countertransference.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Three focus groups were held using a semi-structured interview guide and a hypothetical case study to guide the discussion. Eighteen adults participated in the study, each representing one of three groups of stakeholders (assistive technology service providers, funders and users). Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using an inductive process to develop categories and themes.|Three primary themes emerged from the data: the user of assistive technology is a unique individual; a decision-making process exists; and, assistive technology devices and services are complex. Based on the study results, recommendations for the delivery of assistive technology services are outlined.|The results of this study may be useful for developing funding guidelines, supporting the importance of assistive technology in enabling meaningful activities, and examining current delivery of services in different contexts.

16488179	<TITLE>Influence of CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTM3 and NAT2 genetic polymorphisms in oral cancer susceptibility: results from a case-control study in Rio de Janeiro.</TITLE>Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes are involved in the detoxification of many carcinogens and may be important in modulating cancer susceptibility. CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTM3, and NAT2 polymorphisms were determined in peripheral blood DNA of 231 oral cancer patients and 212 hospital controls in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the PCR-RFLP technique. NAT2 polymorphism distribution was different between cases and controls (P=0.035), with an overrepresentation of NAT2( *)11 mutant allele in controls. Risk analysis showed that NAT2 4/4 individuals (OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.05-3.60) and combined GSTM3 and NAT2 heterozygotes (OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.04-3.66) were at increased oral cancer risk. No statistically significant association was observed for CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 polymorphisms. Our results suggest that NAT2 polymorphism, alone or combined with GSTM3, may modulate susceptibility to oral cancer in Rio de Janeiro.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

For each patient, the RIS-defined CTV (CTV(RIS)) was compared (in terms of the overlap volume with the surrounding bladder, rectum, pubic symphysis, and penile bulb) with the CT-defined CTV(pre) before this registration and also with CTV(post) (the final target volume used for treatment). Similar analyses were done for PTV(RIS), PTV(pre), and PTV(post) defined in each case to be the corresponding CTV + 1-cm margin.|CTV(RIS) overlapped significantly more with the bladder, rectum, and symphysis, but not with the penile bulb, than did either the CTV(pre) or CTV(post). However, the corresponding PTV analyses revealed no significant differences between any of the overlap volumes of any of the PTVs with the bladder, rectum, and penile bulb, but did reveal a significant difference between the PTV(RIS) and PTV(post) overlap volumes with the symphysis compared with PTV(pre) overlap volumes with the symphysis.|On RIS images, there appear to be areas of uptake in the bladder, rectum, and pubic symphysis but not the penile bulb; however, the dosimetric consequences of this uptake for radiation treatment planning are minimal on the bladder, rectum, and penile bulb, but require segmentation for dose reduction to the pubic symphysis.

Risk for low intellectual performance at military conscription, estimated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals was measured.|Compared with men who were born preterm (28-36 weeks) and had normal birth weight for gestational age, men who were born preterm and had a very low birth weight for gestational age were not at increased risk for low intellectual performance. In contrast, men who were born preterm with a very short birth length or a very small head circumference for gestational age faced a near doubled risk for low intellectual performance compared with their appropriate peers. Among men who were born at term (37-41 weeks), risk for low intellectual performance was increased among those with very or moderately small birth weight, birth length, or head circumference for gestational age.|During early stages of gestation, growth in length and head circumference may be more important for intellectual development than weight increase. Future studies on size at birth and intellectual performance should consider also including anthropometric measurements other than birth weight.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
16517231	<TITLE>Low resolution structure of the human alpha4 protein (IgBP1) and studies on the stability of alpha4 and of its yeast ortholog Tap42.</TITLE>The yeast Tap42 and mammalian alpha4 proteins belong to a highly conserved family of regulators of the type 2A phosphatases, which participate in the rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway, connecting nutrient availability to cell growth. The mechanism of regulation involves binding of Tap42 to Sit4 and PPH21/22 in yeast and binding of alpha4 to the catalytic subunits of type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A, PP4 and PP6 in mammals. Both recombinant proteins undergo partial proteolysis, generating stable N-terminal fragments. The full-length proteins and alpha4 C-terminal deletion mutants at amino acids 222 (alpha4Delta222), 236 (alpha4Delta236) and 254 (alpha4Delta254) were expressed in E. coli. alpha4Delta254 undergoes proteolysis, producing a fragment similar to the one generated by full-length alpha4, whereas alpha4Delta222 and alpha4Delta236 are highly stable proteins. alpha4 and Tap42 show alpha-helical circular dichroism spectra, as do their respective N-terminal proteolysis resistant products. The cloned truncated proteins alpha4Delta222 and alpha4Delta236, however, possess a higher content of alpha-helix, indicating that the C-terminal region is less structured, which is consistent with its higher sensitivity to proteolysis. In spite of their higher secondary structure content, alpha4Delta222 and alpha4Delta236 showed thermal unfolding kinetics similar to the full-length alpha4. Based on small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), the calculated radius of gyration for alpha4 and Tap42 were 41.2 +/- 0.8 A and 42.8 +/- 0.7 A and their maximum dimension approximately 142 A and approximately 147 A, respectively. The radii of gyration for alpha4Delta222 and alpha4Delta236 were 21.6 +/- 0.3 A and 25.7 +/- 0.2 A, respectively. Kratky plots show that all studied proteins show variable degree of compactness. Calculation of model structures based on SAXS data showed that alpha4Delta222 and alpha4Delta236 proteins have globular conformation, whereas alpha4 and Tap42 exhibit elongated shapes.

16597460	<TITLE>Increasing trends of total organic carbon concentrations in small forest lakes in Finland from 1987 to 2003.</TITLE>Trends in total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations over the period 1987-2003 were studied in 13 small forest lakes. Recovery from acidification (reduced SO(4) deposition) and long-term changes in runoff as potential drivers for the trends were examined. The results showed that TOC concentrations have increased throughout Finland. Ten of the 13 lakes showed a significant increasing TOC trend (p<0.05), and included both clear water and humic lakes. The largest annual increase in TOC occurred in lakes with the largest average concentrations. The magnitude of the TOC trends were not significantly related to the proportion of peat soils in the catchment but the catchment size was an important predictor. Decreasing SO(4) deposition and improved acid-base status in soil due to the recovery from acidification implied an increased mobilisation of organic acids and TOC. There was little evidence that the long-term increasing trend in TOC concentrations was related to long-term changes in runoff. However, large seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in runoff did appear to affect TOC concentrations for a number of years.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
16623715	<TITLE>SOX10, in combination with Sp1, regulates the endothelin receptor type B gene in human melanocyte lineage cells.</TITLE>Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an auditory-pigmentary disorder that exhibits varying combinations of sensorineural hearing loss and abnormal pigmentation of the hair and skin. WS type 4 (WS4), a subtype of WS, is characterized by the presence of the aganglionic megacolon and is associated with mutations in the gene encoding either endothelin 3, endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB), or Sry-box 10 (SOX10). Here, we provide evidence that SOX10 regulates the expression of EDNRB gene in human melanocyte-lineage cells, as judged by RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. Human melanocytes preferentially express the EDNRB transcripts derived from the conventional EDNRB promoter. SOX10 transactivates the EDNRB promoter through the cis-acting elements, the two CA-rich sequences and the GC box. Moreover, a transcription factor Sp1 enhances the degree of the SOX10-mediated transactivation of the EDNRB promoter through these cis-acting elements. Furthermore, we have shown that the EDNRB promoter is heavily methylated in HeLa human cervical cancer cells, lacking EDNRB expression, but not in melanocytes and HMV-II melanoma cells. The expression of EDNRB became detectable in HeLa cells after treatment with a demethylating reagent, 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, which was further enhanced in the transformed cells over-expressing SOX10. We therefore suggest that SOX10, alone or in combination with Sp1, regulates transcription of the EDNRB gene, thereby ensuring appropriate expression level of EDNRB in human melanocytes.

16631128	<TITLE>Acute stress and nicotine cues interact to unveil locomotor arousal and activity-dependent gene expression in the prefrontal cortex.</TITLE>This study examines the interactive effects of acute stress and nicotine-associated contextual cues on locomotor activity and activity-dependent gene expression in subregions of the prefrontal cortex.|Locomotor activity of rats was measured in a context associated with either low-dose nicotine or saline administration with or without 5 minutes of pre-exposure to ferrets, a nonphysical stressor. After 45 minutes in the test environment, plasma corticosterone levels and mRNA levels of the immediate-early genes Arc, NGFI-B, and c-Fos in prefrontal and primary motor cortical subregions were measured.|Stress alone increased plasma corticosterone and prefrontal cortex gene expression. Low-dose nicotine cues had no effect on corticosterone levels nor did they elicit conditioned motor activation, and they caused minor elevations in gene expression. Stress and low-dose nicotine cues, however, interacted to elicit conditioned motor activation and further increases in early response gene expression in prefrontal but not in the primary motor cortical subregions.|Stress interacts with nicotine-associated cues to uncover locomotor arousal, a state associated with prefrontal neuronal activation and immediate early gene expression. Thus, in nicotine-experienced individuals, stress may be an important determinant of subjective reactivity and prefrontal cortex activation that occurs in response to nicotine-associated cues.

16651473	<TITLE>Thrombopoietin protects against in vitro and in vivo cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin.</TITLE>Doxorubicin (DOX) is an important antineoplastic agent. However, the associated cardiotoxicity, possibly mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species, has remained a significant and dose-limiting clinical problem. Our hypothesis is that the hematopoietic/megakaryocytopoietic growth factor thrombopoietin (TPO) protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and might involve antiapoptotic mechanism exerted on cardiomyocytes.|In vitro investigations on H9C2 cell line and spontaneously beating cells of primary, neonatal rat ventricle, as well as an in vivo study in a mouse model of DOX-induced acute cardiomyopathy, were performed. Our results showed that pretreatment with TPO significantly increased viability of DOX-injured H9C2 cells and beating rates of neonatal myocytes, with effects similar to those of dexrazoxane, a clinically approved cardiac protective agent. TPO ameliorated DOX-induced apoptosis of H9C2 cells as demonstrated by assays of annexin V, active caspase-3, and mitochondrial membrane potential. In the mouse model, administration of TPO (12.5 microg/kg IP for 3 alternate days) significantly reduced DOX-induced (20 mg/kg) cardiotoxicity, including low blood cell count, cardiomyocyte lesions (apoptosis, vacuolization, and myofibrillar loss), and animal mortality. Using Doppler echocardiography, we observed increased heart rate, fractional shortening, and cardiac output in animals pretreated with TPO compared with those receiving DOX alone.|These data have provided the first evidence that TPO is a protective agent against DOX-induced cardiac injury. We propose to further explore an integrated program, incorporating TPO with other protocols, for treatment of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and other forms of cardiomyopathy.	Activation of TPO ameliorated a cardiotoxicity disease model
16663421	<TITLE>Use of zinc ions to study thylakoid protein phosphorylation and the state 1-state 2 transition in vitro.</TITLE>At ATP concentrations less than 0.2 millimolar, zinc ions cause a marked stimulation of endogenous protein phosphorylation in thylakoid membranes isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Turkish Samsun), pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Feltham First) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Northland). The greatest stimulatory effect was observed at Zn(2+) concentrations of 1 to 2 millimolar; higher concentrations were inhibitory. The stimulatory effect of Zn(2+) was independent of Mg(2+) concentration from 1 to 5 millimolar and thus does not appear to be due to the formation of a Zn(2+) -ATP complex. Phosphorylation of histones IIA, an exogenous protein substrate, was inhibited by 2 millimolar Zn(2+). At low levels of ATP, Zn(2+) not only stimulates general endogenous protein phosphorylation, but also the phosphorylation of the apoproteins of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex. However, under these conditions Zn(2+) inhibits the ATP-induced quenching of photosystem II fluorescence and the increase in the ratio of photosystem I to photosystem II fluorescence which are both characteristic of the State 1-State 2 transition. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex may not directly bring about the State 1-State 2 transition.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
16749552	<TITLE>Altered mental status from olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine.</TITLE>Olanzapine is commonly prescribed to patients with schizophrenia. One retrospective study demonstrates the efficacy of physostigmine in reversing mental status changes induced by olanzapine. We report two patients with delirium due to confirmed olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine. One patient's mental status transiently returned to normal. The other patient completely recovered. CASE 1: A 25-year-old man ingested 300 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, he was agitated, delirious, tachycardic, had dry skin and mucous membranes, and dilated pupils (6 mm) minimally reactive to light. Physostigmine, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously (IV) without effect. Additional physostigmine doses of 1.5 mg IV administered 5 minutes later and then 1 mg IV resulted in the patient having a clear sensorium and normal mentation. The patient's mental status continued to remain normal for the duration of his hospital stay. Olanzapine was identified in the urine by high performance liquid chromatography. CASE 2: A 20-year-old female ingested 600 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, she was tachycardic, obtunded, and minimally responsive to painful stimuli, with decreased bowel sounds, dry skin and dry mucous membranes. Physostigmine, 2 mg, was given IV. Shortly thereafter she regained full consciousness and began speaking coherently. She remained in this condition for approximately 30 minutes, and then became obtunded. Her serum olanzapine concentration was 1230 ng/mL. No further doses of physostigmine were administered. On day 3 of admission her mental status returned to normal.|We report two cases of olanzapine-induced mental status changes treated with physostigmine. The utility of physostigmine as a safe or necessary antidote in the setting of olanzapine overdose remains to be determined.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
16784209	<TITLE>Enhancing waste decomposition and methane production in simulated landfill using combined anaerobic reactors.</TITLE>The design of leachate recirculation to enhance municipal solid waste decomposition, methane production and microbial activities was taken into account in this study by using the combined anaerobic reactors of a simulated high organic content landfill reactor and a stabilized fixed film anaerobic reactor. The latter aimed to treat high strength leachate from the simulated landfill reactor before recirculation back to the former reactor. The results showed the possibility to apply this technique to high organic waste landfill where rapid and accumulative acids formed in the leachate were removed and treated by a fixed film anaerobic reactor. In addition, the treated leachate when circulated back to the simulated bioreactor landfill helps accelerate waste decomposition and methane production by providing buffer capacity as well as diluting organic content in the leachate to achieve the favourable conditions for acidogen and methanogen, respectively, to rapidly enter into the methanogenesis phase.

16800864	<TITLE>Ethanol withdrawal induces hyperalgesia mediated by PKCepsilon.</TITLE>Symptoms of ethanol withdrawal include heightened responses to sensory stimuli, as well as tremors and convulsions. We tested the hypothesis that repeated episodes of ethanol intake and withdrawal exacerbate the symptoms of alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy. In contrast to the hyperalgesia produced when an alcohol (6.5%)-containing diet was fed continuously to male rats which took 4 weeks to develop (Dina et al., 2000), feeding alcohol (6.5%) in repeated cycles of 4 days of alcohol followed by 3 days without alcohol resulted in a withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia that began at the end of one weekly cycle and reached a maximum during the fourth cycle. For ethanol withdrawal to produce hyperalgesia, ethanol consumption needed to be terminated for a period of 2 days. Paradoxically, as the amount of alcohol consumed decreased, the hyperalgesia induced by withdrawal developed more rapidly, being maximal between 1.4 and 1.6% ethanol. These results suggest that continued exposure to ethanol also has a neuroprotective effect. Withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, similar to the hyperalgesia induced by continuous, chronic alcohol intake, was inhibited reversibly by intrathecal administration of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to protein kinase C (PKC)epsilon.	Inhibition of PKCepsilon ameliorated a hyperalgesia disease model
16806639	<TITLE>Influence of medical direction on the management of prehospital myocardial infarction.</TITLE>Prehospital management of myocardial infarction was evaluated in two differently structured Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems in Southern Finland: a physician directed EMS with on-site physician involvement (physician EMS) and an EMS without operational physician involvement with paramedics only (non-physician EMS). The management of 641 consecutive acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients between 1997 and 1999 (263 patients in the physician EMS group and 378 patients in non-physician EMS group) were studied. Patients treated in the physician EMS received all necessary medical care including thrombolytic therapy at the scene whereas patients in the non-physician EMS were transported to hospital for definitive treatment after initial care. There were no differences in the demographics of the patients. The delays from onset of pain to initiation of thrombolysis were shorter in the physician EMS-group (124+/-101 min (25-723) versus 196+/-150 min (12-835), p<0.001). In 2% of the patients in the physician EMS group the pain to therapy-time was unknown compared to 27% in the non-physician EMS group (p<0.001). Fifty-two patients (20%) in the physician EMS received thrombolytic therapy after cardiopulmonary resuscitation compared to two patients in the non-physician EMS (p<0.001). Of the resuscitated patients in the physician directed EMS group 60% were discharged from the hospital, and 44% of these had a good neurological recovery. We conclude that a physician directed EMS is able to reduce the pain to therapy delays significantly in STEMI patients and may offer thrombolytic therapy to a wider patient group compared to an EMS without operational medical involvement.

16906573	<TITLE>ZAP-70 by flow cytometry: a comparison of different antibodies, anticoagulants, and methods of analysis.</TITLE>The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is variable. ZAP-70 expression is believed to provide prognostic information. The flow cytometric detection of ZAP-70 is difficult because it is an intracellular antigen with weak expression in CLL. Consensus has not been reached as to the best method for measurement.|We analyzed 72 CLL patient samples for ZAP-70 expression and IgVH mutational status. Sensitivity and specificity of ZAP-70 expression against IgVH mutational status were assessed for two clones (2F3.2 and 1E7.2) and for four methods of analysis: percentage positivity (PP), comparing test to isotype control, ratio of geometric means of test and isotype control, and percentage and ratiometric methods comparing test and T/NK cell populations. The effects of anticoagulant, collection times, and time to analysis were also evaluated.|Sensitivity and specificity were 85 and 88%, respectively, for Upstate PP; 70 and 88% for Caltag PP; 89 and 91% for Upstate ratio; 89 and 88% for Caltag ratio. Intraobserver variability was smaller when ZAP-70 expression was assessed using a ratiometric approach rather than the percentage method. By 48 h, we observed an average decrease of 13% in the Caltag ratio in the heparin preserved samples compared to an increase of 3% in those collected in EDTA. Within the first 24-h period, a greater percent variability was observed in those samples collected into EDTA compared with heparin.|Our data support a rapid method for ZAP-70 measurement using commercially available fixation/permeabilization reagents, a conjugated antibody, and a ratiometric method of analysis that minimizes subjective interpretation of the results. This is a method of ZAP-70 assessment that could be included in a routine diagnostic CLL panel; however, the choice of anticoagulant and time of analysis after collection are critical factors in accurate assessment of ZAP-70 expression.

17015319	<TITLE>Locating the barnacle settlement pheromone: spatial and ontogenetic expression of the settlement-inducing protein complex of Balanus amphitrite.</TITLE>Barnacles are prominent members of hard substratum benthic communities and their study has been important to advances in experimental ecology and contemporary ecological theory. Having recently characterized the cue to gregarious settlement of Balanus amphitrite, the settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC), we use two polyclonal antibodies to examine the tissue distribution and ontogenetic expression of this glycoprotein. These antibodies were raised against two separate peptides located near the N- and C-termini of the SIPC and were used to detect the glycoprotein by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. By in situ hybridization we also show that the SIPC mRNA co-occurs with the expressed glycoprotein in the cuticles of both nauplius and cypris larval stages and the adult. In the larvae, the SIPC is expressed most strongly in the mouthparts and the hindgut of the stage 2 nauplius and in the thoracopods, antennules and bivalved carapace of the cyprid. In adult B. amphitrite, the expressed SIPC is present in protein extracts of the shell and in all organs that are lined by cuticular tissues. We suggest that the SIPC is produced by the epidermal cells that secrete the cuticle and discuss these observations with regard to earlier studies and the role of the SIPC as a contact pheromone.

17029189	<TITLE>Principles of microneurosurgery for safe and fast surgery.</TITLE>Since their introduction by Prof. Yaşargil in the 1960s, Microneurosurgical techniques have been the essentials of neurosurgical practice. Principles of Microneurosurgery are mainly based upon handling the lesions of different characteristics that can be localized in any part of the nervous system. Whereas the aim is to treat these lesions with efficacy and precision, the performance should be non-traumatic and minimally invasive. Delicate movements of instruments under the magnification of an operating microscope require a good knowledge of Microneurosurgical anatomy and experience. Professional teamwork is the essential part of Microneurosurgical operations. Fascinating approaches are not practical unless combined with appropriate positioning and optimal conduction of Neuroanesthesia. Although the neurosurgical operations are highly dependent on technological advancements, their use should be adjusted according to personal preferences and financial resources. To keep the operations simple and fast, and appreciate normal anatomy, only a limited array of instruments is preferable for use. The basic principles of Microneurosurgery discussed in this chapter are based on the Helsinki and Kuopio Neurosurgery practices in Finland, as well as the Senior Author's (J.H.) experience in approximately 10,000 microsurgery operations. The question to be addressed is: How does one perform operations safer and faster while preserving the normal anatomy?	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
17044854	<TITLE>Mutational spectrum and linkage disequilibrium patterns at the ornithine transcarbamylase gene (OTC).</TITLE>Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC; EC 2.1.3.3) is a hepatic enzyme involved in ammonia elimination via the urea cycle. Since the sequence of the OTC gene was reported many types of mutations continue to be found in OTC deficiency patients, continuing to increase the already wide mutational spectrum known for this gene. In this study we present the clinical, biochemical and molecular features of thirteen late-onset OTC deficiency patients. Mutations were identified in all these patients, among which six were novel point substitutions (L59R, A137P, L148S, Y176L, L186P, and K210N) and one was a 2-bp deletion at exon 4 (341-342delAA). In addition, a de novo genomic deletion of maternal origin encompassing exons 1 to 5 was also identified by the analysis of LD patterns using intragenic polymorphic markers. This work exemplifies the potential value of population genetic studies for the detection of large deletions.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
17067833	<TITLE>A hematologist's view of unexplained iron deficiency anemia in males: impact of Helicobacter pylori eradication.</TITLE>Helicobacter pylori infection with, or without coexisting autoimmune gastritis has been implicated in several recent studies as an important cause of IDA in patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IDA). However, the role of H. pylori in the causation of IDA is still unsettled as the vast majority of reported patients were premenopausal women in whom menstrual blood loss was likely the dominant factor determining IDA.|Prospective study of 44 consecutive male IDA patients referred for hematologic evaluation. Following standard endoscopic studies, all patients were screened for non-bleeding GI conditions including celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis and H. pylori gastritis. All subject with H. pylori infection were offered triple therapy for H. pylori eradication.|Only 15 patients had a likely source of blood loss identified. The 29 males with "unexplained" IDA were distinguished by their younger age (36+/-20 vs. 57+/-17 years p<0.001), poor initial response to oral iron treatment, and high prevalence of H. pylori infection (25 of 29 vs. 5 of 15 p<0.0001) with (10) or without (15) coexistent autoimmune gastritis. Three had celiac disease. Following H. pylori eradication, all patients achieved normal hemoglobin levels with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 69 months (38+/-15 months mean+/-1SD). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in H. pylori IgG antibodies and serum gastrin. Sixteen patients discontinued iron treatment, maintaining normal hemoglobin and ferritin and may be considered cured. Remarkably, 4 of the 16 achieved normal hemoglobin without ever having received oral iron after H. pylori eradication.|The favorable long-term clinical results of H. pylori eradication offer strong evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between H. pylori and IDA. Recognition of the respective roles of H. pylori and autoimmune gastritis in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency may have a strong impact on the clinical management of unexplained and refractory iron deficiency anemia.

17202489	<TITLE>NGF regulates the expression of axonal LINGO-1 to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.</TITLE>Neurons and glia share a mutual dependence in establishing a functional relationship, and none is more evident than the process by which axons control myelination. Here, we identify LRR and Ig domain-containing, Nogo receptor-interacting protein (LINGO-1) as a potent axonal inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination that is regulated by nerve growth factor and its cognate receptor TrkA in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas LINGO-1 expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was previously identified as an inhibitor of differentiation, we demonstrate that axonal expression of LINGO-1 inhibits differentiation with equal potency. Disruption of LINGO-1 on either cell type is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory action and promote differentiation and myelination, independent of axon diameter. Furthermore, these results were recapitulated in transgenic mice overexpressing the full length LINGO-1 under the neuronal promoter synapsin. Myelination was greatly inhibited in the presence of enforced axonal LINGO-1. The implications of these results relate specifically to the development of potential therapeutics targeting extrinsic growth factors that may regulate the axonal expression of modulators of oligodendrocyte development.

17252021	<TITLE>Effect of priming with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in younger adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: a trial by the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) Group.</TITLE>In a multicenter trial, 259 young adults (15-49 years) with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were first randomized to receive a timed-sequential induction regimen given either alone (135 patients) or concomitantly with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (124 patients). Patients reaching complete remission (CR) were then randomized to compare a timed-sequential consolidation to a postremission chemotherapy including four cycles of high-dose cytarabine followed by maintenance courses. In the appropriate arm, GM-CSF was given concurrently with chemotherapy during all cycles of consolidation. CR rates were significantly better in the GM-CSF arm (88 vs 78%, P<0.04), but did not differ after salvage. Patients receiving GM-CSF had a higher 3-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate (42 vs 34%), but GM-CSF did not impact on overall survival. Patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics benefited more from GM-CSF therapy (P=0.05) in terms of EFS than patients with other cytogenetics. This was also confirmed when considering only patients following the second randomization, or subgroups defined by a prognostic index based on cytogenetics and the number of courses required for achieving CR. Priming of leukemic cells with hematopoietic growth factors is a means of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in younger adults with AML.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

17414197	<TITLE>Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine: an innovative approach to medical education and the training of physician investigators.</TITLE>Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) is an innovative, five-year medical education track within Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (Case) with a focused mission to attract and educate a limited number of highly qualified persons who seek to become physician investigators. CCLCM curriculum governance, faculty appointments and promotions, and admissions committees are integrated with respective Case committees. The CCLCM curriculum is based on faculty-defined professional attributes that graduates are expected to develop. These attributes were used to create curricular and assessment principles that guided the development of an integrated basic science, clinical science, and research curriculum, conducted in an active learning environment. An organ-system approach is used to solidify an understanding of basic science discipline threads in the context of relevant clinical problems presented in PBL and case-based discussion formats. Clinical skills are introduced in the first year as part of the two-year longitudinal experience with a family practice or internal medicine physician. The research program provides all students with opportunities to learn and experience basic and translational research and clinical research before selecting a research topic for their 12- to 15-month master-level thesis project. All Case students participate in required and elective clinical curriculum after the second year, but CCLCM students return to the Cleveland Clinic on selected Friday afternoons for program-specific research and professionalism-learning activities. A unique portfolio-based assessment system is used to assess student achievements in nine competency areas, seven of which reflect the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies.

17428755	<TITLE>Evidence of proactive forefoot control during landings on inclined surfaces.</TITLE>The notion of proactive control of landings is generally accepted, and some underlying mechanisms have already been described. Only little is known on adjustments at the foot level, however. The authors therefore investigated the foot and ankle behavior of 24 participants as they landed on differently inclined surfaces. A 4-segment model of the foot and ankle provided 3-dimensional kinematics. They also analyzed activation patterns from several muscles and the ground reaction force. Participants anticipated the different surfaces, as shown by the forefoot kinematics and the activation patterns before touch down. Anticipation of the surface inclination led to adjustments in forefoot orientation and probably also in joint stiffness. The authors suggest that those adjustments tend to enhance the self-stabilizing potential of the mechanical system. The enhancement of that potential would ease the subsequent stabilization, reducing the demands on the neural system.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

17505121	<TITLE>The effect of energy balance on endocrine function and bone health in youth.</TITLE>Female athletes are susceptible to both disordered eating and menstrual cycle disturbances (MCDs). Disordered eating in combination with high energy expenditure from exercise can lead to energy deprivation. Current theories suggest that MCDs are caused by energy deprivation rather than by exercise alone. A number of endocrine adaptations occur with energy deprivation and MCDs, which are concomitant with imbalanced bone turnover, reduced bone density and potentially increased fracture risk. This chapter reviews current evidence concerning the disruption of bone metabolism that accompanies disordered eating and MCDs in physically active girls and young women, including high-performance athletes. Initially, an overview of the aetiology of exercise-associated MCDs and their link with disordered eating is provided. Thereafter, studies reporting changes in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in female athletes with MCDs are considered in conjunction with change in athletes' physical activity, nutritional status and menstrual histories. A comprehensive overview of the disruption of bone metabolism that accompanies nutritionally related MCDs is also provided. Emphasis is placed upon the role of energy deprivation and its endocrine effects, which, when sustained, result in imbalanced bone turnover and low aBMD. Based on current evidence, recommendations are made for the prevention and treatment of disturbed bone metabolism and low BMD in female athletes with MCDs. Finally, consideration is given to the effects of intense training and energy deprivation on endocrine function and skeletal health in men.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

17544855	<TITLE>Exposure to TBT increases accumulation of lipids and alters fatty acid homeostasis in the ramshorn snail Marisa cornuarietis.</TITLE>Recent studies have shown that organotin compounds affect lipid homeostasis in vertebrates, probably through interaction with RXR and/or PPARgamma receptors. Molluscs are sensitive species to the toxic effects of tributyltin (TBT), particularly to masculinization, and TBT has been recently shown to bind to molluscs RXR. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to TBT could affect lipid homeostasis in the ramshorn snail Marisa cornuarietis. For comparative purposes, the synthetic androgen methyl-testosterone (MT) was included in the study due to its masculinization effects, but its lack of binding to the RXR receptor. M. cornuarietis was exposed to different concentrations of TBT (30, 125, 500 ng/L as Sn) and MT (30, 300 ng/L) for 100 days. Females exposed to 500 ng/L TBT showed increased percentage of lipids and increased levels of fatty acids in the digestive gland/gonad complex (2- to 3-fold). In addition, fatty acid profiles were altered in both males and females exposed to 125 and 500 ng/L TBT. These effects were not observed in females exposed to MT. Overall, this work suggest that TBT acts as a potent inducer of lipid and fatty acid accumulation in M. cornuarietis as shown in vertebrate studies earlier, and that sex differences in sensitivity do exist.

17560802	<TITLE>Assessment of the canine model of rotator cuff injury and repair.</TITLE>Animal shoulder models are used to systematically investigate the factors influencing rotator cuff injury and repair. Each model has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered in the context of the specific research questions being asked. This study evaluated the utility of the canine model for studies of acute, full-thickness rotator cuff tendon injury and repair. We found that time-zero failure load is dependent on the suture type and configuration used for repair. Acute, full-width tendon repairs fail anatomically within the first days after surgery in the canine model, regardless of suture type, suture configuration, or postoperative protocol. Robust scar tissue forms in the gap between the failed tendon end and the humerus, which can be visually, mechanically, and histologically misconstrued as tendon if an objective test of repair connectivity is not performed. We conclude that a full-width injury and repair model in the canine will provide a rigorous test of whether a new repair strategy or postoperative protocol, such as casting or temporary muscle paralysis, can maintain repair integrity in a high-load environment. Alternatively, a partial-width tendon injury model allows loads to be shared between the tendon repair and the remaining intact portion of the infraspinatus tendon and prohibits complete tendon retraction. Thus a partial-width injury in the canine may model the mechanical environment of many single tendon tears in the human injury condition and warrants further investigation.

17567887	<TITLE>Molecular genetics study of deafness in Brazil: 8-year experience.</TITLE>Hereditary hearing loss is a complex disorder that involves a large number of genes. In developed countries, 1 in 1,000 children is born with deafness severe enough to require special education services, and about 60% of the cases of isolated deafness have a genetic origin. Although more than 100 genes for hearing loss are known currently, only a few are routinely tested in the clinical practice. In this study, we present our findings from the molecular diagnostic screening of the GJB2 and GJB3 genes, del(GJB6-D13S1,830) and del(GJB6-D13S1,854) deletions in the GJB6 gene, Q829X mutation in the otoferlin gene (OTOF) and, the A1,555G and A7,445G mutations in the mitochondrial genome over an 8-year period. Mutations analysis in the previously mentioned genes and mutations was performed on 645 unrelated Brazilian patients with hearing loss who fell into two different testing groups. Different mutations in the GJB2 gene were responsible for most of cases studied, but deletions in the GJB6 gene as well as mitochondrial mutations were also found. While most cases of hearing loss in this country are due to environmental factors, the genetic etiology of deafness will increasingly be determined as more genetic tests become available.

17580459	<TITLE>Quality of impressions using hydrophilic polyvinyl siloxane in a clinical study of 249 patients.</TITLE>This study aimed to evaluate the clinical success of a hydrophilic polyvinyl siloxane impression material for fixed dental restorations under various clinical conditions.|A total of 1,466 preparations for fixed restorations in maxillary and mandibular anterior and posterior teeth were evaluated. The study contained inlay, onlay, crown, veneer, post, and adhesive-wing preparations and implants for gold, porcelain-fused-to-metal, and ceramic restorations. The preparation finish line relative to the crest of the marginal gingiva, type of restoration, and position of the teeth were recorded. Three categories were established to rate impression quality: perfect impressions, with an absence of any voids or bubbles and perfect reproduction of the preparation finish line, were rated Criteria I; acceptable impressions, with minimal defects (< or = 2 mm) not involving the preparation finish line, were rated Criteria II; and unacceptable impressions, with larger voids or bubbles (> 2 mm) or defects involving the preparation finish line, were rated Criteria III.|Overall, 96.86% of the final impressions were clinically acceptable, 89.43% of which were rated Criteria I and 7.43% of which were rated Criteria II. Only 3.14% of the impressions were unacceptable and rated Criteria III. A significant influence on impression quality was found when the preparation finish line was more than 2 mm subgingival (P < .004), as well as when a beveled preparation was used (P < .004). The position of the teeth (P > .404) had no significant effect.|Surface-activated polyvinyl siloxane impression material offers high predictability to avoid bubbles and voids in the final impression.

Previous studies describe satisfying anatomical and functional results. In this study we examined the largest cohort so far for a 9-month follow-up and performed a comparison to conventional silicone oil.|Our study documents results and adverse effects after vitreoretinal surgery and endotamponade with Densiron 68 in 99 cases of complicated retinal detachment. A 9-month follow-up was performed. Data of 21 patients with intraocular conventional silicone oil tamponade in complicated retinal detachment were retrospectively analyzed and served as control.|Anatomical success was achieved in 78 of 89 eyes (87.6%) with completed follow-up; visual acuity did not change significantly (from mean preoperative logMAR 1.88 to postoperative logMAR 1.96 (p = 0.9). Compared to control a higher anatomical success but a similar number of adverse effects were observed with heavy silicone oil in vitreous. Nevertheless, patients who received Densiron 68 twice due to redetachment showed a significantly higher rate of intraocular inflammation with the tamponade agent in situ.|Our results support the hypothesis of Densiron 68 as potent tamponade agent for complicated retinal detachment in the inferior retinal segments especially in eyes where a previous operation failed.

17615369	<TITLE>Increased protein nitration burden in the atherosclerotic lesions and plasma of apolipoprotein A-I deficient mice.</TITLE>Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent within high-density lipoprotein (HDL), has been associated with antiatherogenic protection by mechanisms that include reverse cholesterol transport and antiinflammatory functions. To evaluate the proposed protective function of apoA-I, proteins modified by nitrating oxidants were evaluated in the aortic tissue and plasma of mice lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apobec (LA) and LA mice with genetic deletion of apoA-I (LA-apoA-I(-/-)). The levels of nitrated proteins in aortic tissue quantified by liquid chromatography with online electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) were 6-fold higher in the LA-apoA-I(-/-) as compared with the LA mice. The quantitative analyses were corroborated by immunohistochemical and high-resolution immunoelectron microscopic evaluation of the lesions, which revealed abundant staining for nitrated proteins in the aortic root lesions of LA-apoA-I(-/-) as compared with the LA mice. Proteomic approaches based on affinity enrichment and site-specific adduct mapping identified unique specific protein targets for nitration in the plasma of LA-apoA-I(-/-) that were not present in the plasma of LA mice. In particular the nitration of fibrinogen was shown to accelerate fibrin clot formation. Another consequence of the augmented levels of nitrated proteins was the induction of humoral responses documented by the increased circulating immunoglobulins that recognize nitrotyrosine in LA-apoA-I(-/-) as compared with the LA mice. These data collectively support a protective function of apoA-I diminishing the burden of nitrative oxidants in these mice models of atherosclerosis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
17620145	<TITLE>Distinguishing patterns in the dynamics of long-term medication use by Markov analysis: beyond persistence.</TITLE>In order to accurately distinguish gaps of varying length in drug treatment for chronic conditions from discontinuation without resuming therapy, short-term observation does not suffice. Thus, the use of inhalation corticosteroids (ICS) in the long-term, during a ten-year period is investigated. To describe medication use as a continuum, taking into account the timeliness and consistency of refilling, a Markov model is proposed.|Patients, that filled at least one prescription in 1993, were selected from the PHARMO medical record linkage system (RLS) containing >95% prescription dispensings per patient originating from community pharmacy records of 6 medium-sized cities in the Netherlands.The probabilities of continuous use, the refilling of at least one ICS prescription in each year of follow-up, and medication free periods were assessed by Markov analysis. Stratified analysis according to new use was performed.|The transition probabilities of the refilling of at least one ICS prescription in the subsequent year of follow-up, were assessed for each year of follow-up and for the total study period.The change of transition probabilities in time was evaluated, e.g. the probability of continuing ICS use of starters in the first two years (51%) of follow-up increased to more than 70% in the following years. The probabilities of different patterns of medication use were assessed: continuous use (7.7%), cumulative medication gaps (1-8 years 69.1%) and discontinuing (23.2%) during ten-year follow-up for new users. New users had lower probability of continuous use (7.7%) and more variability in ICS refill patterns than previous users (56%).|In addition to well-established methods in epidemiology to ascertain compliance and persistence, a Markov model could be useful to further specify the variety of possible patterns of medication use within the continuum of adherence. This Markov model describes variation in behaviour and patterns of ICS use and could also be useful to investigate continuous use of other drugs applied in chronic diseases.

17643103	<TITLE>Crystal structure of the IL-15-IL-15Ralpha complex, a cytokine-receptor unit presented in trans.</TITLE>Interleukin 15 (IL-15) and IL-2, which promote the survival of memory CD8(+) T cells and regulatory T cells, respectively, bind receptor complexes that share beta- and gamma-signaling subunits. Receptor specificity is provided by unique, nonsignaling alpha-subunits. Whereas IL-2 receptor-alpha (IL-2Ralpha) is expressed together in cis with the beta- and gamma-subunits on T cells and B cells, IL-15Ralpha is expressed in trans on antigen-presenting cells. Here we present a 1.85-A crystal structure of the human IL-15-IL-15Ralpha complex. The structure provides insight into the molecular basis of the specificity of cytokine recognition and emphasizes the importance of water in generating this very high-affinity complex. Despite very low IL-15-IL-2 sequence homology and distinct receptor architecture, the topologies of the IL-15-IL-15Ralpha and IL-2-IL-2Ralpha complexes are very similar. Our data raise the possibility that IL-2, like IL-15, might be capable of being presented in trans in the context of its unique receptor alpha-chain.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
17658895	<TITLE>Steric interactions stabilize the signaling state of the LOV2 domain of phototropin 1.</TITLE>Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are blue light receptor kinases that control a range of photoresponses that serve to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. Light sensing by the phototropins is mediated by a repeated motif at the N-terminal region of the protein known as the LOV domain. Bacterially expressed LOV domains bind flavin mononucleotide noncovalently and are photochemically active in solution. Irradiation of the LOV domain results in the formation of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct (LOV390) which thermally relaxes back to the ground state in the dark, effectively completing a photocycle that serves as a molecular switch to control receptor kinase activity. We have employed a random mutagenesis approach to identify further amino acid residues involved in LOV-domain photochemistry. Escherichia coli colonies expressing a mutagenized population of LOV2 derived from Avena sativa (oat) phot1 were screened for variants that showed altered photochemical reactivity in response to blue light excitation. One variant showed slower rates of LOV390 formation but exhibited adduct decay times 1 order of magnitude faster than wild type. A single Ile --> Val substitution was responsible for the effects observed, which removes a single methyl group found in van der Waals contact with the cysteine sulfur involved in adduct formation. A kinetic acceleration trend was observed for adduct decay by decreasing the size of the isoleucine side chain. Our findings therefore indicate that the steric nature of this amino acid side chain contributes to stabilization of the C-S cysteinyl adduct.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
17682727	<TITLE>Changes of dopamine receptors in mice with olivocerebellar degeneration.</TITLE>Lurcher mutants are mice with functional mutation in the 82 glutamate receptor (GluRdelta2) that is predominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and plays a crucial role in cerebellar functions. These mice display ataxia and impaired motor-related learning tasks. In order to elucidate the role of dopaminergic receptor system in coping with mutation in delta2 glutamate receptor the behavioral effect (spatial learning) of D1 dopamine receptor activation and inhibition and changes in D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum in C57BI/7 and C3H Lurcher mutants and wild type mice were studied. We have found that Lurcher mutants were worse in the spatial learning but mice of both types reacted similarly to D1 dopamine receptor agonist (without effect) and antagonist (worsening). Moreover, Lurchers revealed substantial higher density of both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in hippocampus in C57BI/7 strain, while in C3H strain only D1-like dopamine receptors were higher. In C57BI/7 strain, D-like dopamine receptors were lower in cerebellum; D2-like dopamine receptors were not affected. In the striatum, the receptor densities were similar to the wild type counterparts. Our results suggest specific participation of dopamine receptor system in coping with olivocerebellar degeneration.

17822917	<TITLE>Interleukin-10 is upregulated by nanomolar rosiglitazone treatment of mature dendritic cells and human CD4+ T cells.</TITLE>Activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma are anti-inflammatory and have been proposed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Th1-type inflammatory diseases. We report that nanomolar concentrations of rosiglitazone enhance the production of IL-10 from activated human mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Also, rosiglitazone specifically induces the production of IL-10 from TCR-activated human CD4+ T cells and that this effect is PPAR-gamma-dependent. We also demonstrate for the first time the presence of a functional PPAR response element (PPRE) in the human IL-10 promoter region. Finally we show that rosiglitazone can induce IL-10 in combination with 1,25 alpha-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to a greater extent than each treatment alone. In summary our findings demonstrate that IL-10 is upregulated by nanomolar TZDs in immune cells, and this may, in part, be responsible for the potential anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-gamma in humans.

Pretreatments with sublethal stresses [40 degrees C, 0.5 mol l(-1) NaCl, 1.0 mol l(-1) sorbitol or 5% (v/v) ethanol] increased freeze tolerance. Temperature or hyperosmotic prestresses increased trehalose contents, nevertheless no clear correlation was found with improved FT tolerance. Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology were applied to improve freeze tolerance of the more osmotolerant strain. Optimal prestress conditions found were: 0.779 mol l(-1) NaCl, 0.693% (v/v) ethanol and 32.15 degrees C.|Ethanol, saline, osmotic or heat prestresses increased freezing tolerance of two phenotypically distinct baker's yeast strains. A relationship among prestresses, survival and trehalose content was not clear. It was possible to statistically find optimal combined prestress conditions to increase FT tolerance of the osmotolerant strain.|Statistically designed combination of prestress conditions that can be applied during the production of baker's yeast could represent a useful tool to increase baker's yeast FT resistance.

17933157	<TITLE>Efficacy of risperidone for prevention of postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery.</TITLE>This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was primarily aimed to evaluate the potential of risperidone to prevent postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and the secondary objective was to explore clinical factors associated with postoperative delirium. One-hundred-and-twenty-six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg of risperidone or placebo sublingually when they regained consciousness. Delirium and other outcomes were assessed. The confusion assessment method for intensive care unit was used to assess postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium in the risperidone group was lower than the placebo group (11.1% vs. 31.7% respectively, P=0.009, relative risk = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16-0.77). Other postoperative outcomes were not statistically different between the groups. In exploring the factors associated with delirium, univariate analysis showed many factors were associated with postoperative delirium. However multiple logistic regression analysis showed a lapse of 70 minutes from the time of opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors (P=0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.66-12.59 and P=0.038, OR = 13.78, 95% CI = 1.15-165.18 respectively). A single dose of risperidone administered soon after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. Multiple factors tended to be associated with postoperative delirium, but only the time from opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors in this study.

17938118	<TITLE>Stable annual pattern of water use by Acacia tortilis in Sahelian Africa.</TITLE>Water use by mature trees of Acacia tortilis (Forsk.) Hayne ssp. raddiana (Savi) Brenan var. raddiana growing in the northern Sahel was continuously recorded over 4 years. Water use was estimated from xylem sap flow measured by transient heat dissipation. Concurrently, cambial growth, canopy phenology, leaf water potential, climatic conditions and soil water availability (SWA) were monitored. In addition to the variation attributable to interannual variation in rainfall, SWA was increased by irrigation during one wet season. The wet season lasted from July to September, and annual rainfall ranged between 146 and 367 mm. The annual amount and pattern of tree water use were stable from year-to-year despite interannual and seasonal variations in SWA in the upper soil layers. Acacia tortilis transpired readily throughout the year, except for one month during the dry season when defoliation was at a maximum. Maximum water use of about 23 l (dm sapwood area)(-2) day(-1) was recorded at the end of the wet season. While trees retained foliage in the dry season, the decline in water use was modest at around 30%. Variation in predawn leaf water potential indicated that the trees were subject to soil water constraint. The rapid depletion of water in the uppermost soil layers after the wet season implies that there was extensive use of water from deep soil layers. The deep soil profile revealed (1) the existence of living roots at 25 m and (2) that the availability of soil water was low (-1.6 MPa) down to the water table at a depth of 31 m. However, transpiration was recorded at a predawn leaf water potential of -2.0 MPa, indicating that the trees used water from both intermediary soil layers and the water table. During the full canopy stage, mean values of whole-tree hydraulic conductance were similar in the wet and dry seasons. We propose that the stability of water use at the seasonal and annual scales resulted from a combination of features, including an extensive rooting habit related to deep water availability and an effective regulation of canopy conductance. Despite a limited effect on tree water use, irrigation during the wet season sharply increased predawn leaf water potential and cambial growth of trunks and branches.

17942721	<TITLE>Bihemispheric leftward bias in a visuospatial attention-related network.</TITLE>Asymmetry of spatial attention has long been described in both disease (hemispatial neglect) and healthy (pseudoneglect) states. Although right-hemisphere specialization for spatial attention has been suggested, the exact neural mechanisms of asymmetry have not been deciphered yet. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study from our laboratory serendipitously revealed bihemispheric left-hemifield superiority in activation of a visuospatial attention-related network. Nineteen right-handed healthy adult females participated in two experiments of visual half-field presentation. Either facial expressions (experiment 1) or house images (experiment 2) were presented unilaterally and parafoveally for 150 ms while subjects were engaging a central fixation task. Brain regions previously associated with a visuospatial attention network, in both hemispheres, were found to be more robustly activated by left visual field stimuli. The consistency of this finding with manifestations of attention lateralization is discussed, and a revised model based on neural connectivity asymmetry is proposed. Support for the revised model is given by a dynamic causal modeling analysis. Unraveling the basis for attention asymmetry may lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of attention disorders, followed by improved diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, the proposed model for asymmetry of visuospatial attention might provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying functional brain lateralization in general.

17990967	<TITLE>Metabolism of reactive oxygen species is attenuated in leghemoglobin-deficient nodules of Lotus japonicus.</TITLE>Leghemoglobins together with high rates of respiration are believed to be major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in root nodules of leguminous plants. High capacities of antioxidative systems apparently protect this organ from oxidative damage. Using leghemoglobin-RNA interference (LbRNAi) lines of Lotus japonicus, we found that loss of leghemoglobin results in significantly lower H(2)O(2) levels in nodules. Transcript levels and catalytic activities of ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes involved in H(2)O(2) detoxification as well as concentrations of reduced ascorbate were also altered in LbRNAi nodules. Thus, symbiotic leghemoglobins contribute significantly to ROS generation in functional nodules.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

For the meta-analysis, the relative risk of a fall per occupied bed day (RR(fall)) and the relative risk of being a faller (RR(faller)) were calculated.|Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, of which four studies tested multifactorial interventions. Although these studies took place in hospitals, most were conducted on long-stay (mean length of stay (LOS) >1.5 years) and rehabilitation units (mean LOS 36.9 days). For analysis of the number of falls, one unifactorial and two multifactorial studies showed a significant reduction of 30% to 49% in the intervention group, with the greatest effect obtained in the unifactorial study that assessed a pharmacological intervention. The pooled RR(fall) for the four multifactorial studies became nonsignificant after adjustment for clustering (RR(fall)=0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.65-1.03). No studies reported a significant reduction, either single or pooled, in the number of fallers in the intervention group (pooled RR(faller)-0.87, 95% CI=0.70-1.08).|This meta-analysis found no conclusive evidence that hospital fall prevention programs can reduce the number of falls or fallers, although more studies are needed to confirm the tendency observed in the analysis of individual studies that targeting a patient's most important risk factors for falls actively helps in reducing the number of falls. These interventions seem to be useful only on long-stay care units.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18087478	<TITLE>Photon-counting technique for rapid fluorescence-decay measurement.</TITLE>We report on a novel laser-induced fluorescence triple-integration method (LIFTIME) that is capable of making rapid, continuous fluorescence lifetime measurements by a unique photon-counting technique. The LIFTIME has been convolved with picosecond time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence, which employs a high-repetition-rate mode-locked laser, permitting the eventual monitoring of instantaneous species concentrations in turbulent flames. We verify the technique by application of the LIFTIME to two known fluorescence media, diphenyloxazole (PPO) and quinine sulfate monohydrate (QSM). PPO has a fluorescence lifetime of 1.28 ns, whereas QSM has a fluorescence lifetime that can be varied from 1.0 to 3.0 ns. From these liquid samples we demonstrate that fluorescence lifetime can currently be monitored at a sampling rate of up to 500 Hz with less than 10% uncertainty (1 sigma) .

18158565	<TITLE>Transcriptional characterization of the Notch signaling pathway in rodent multipotent adult progenitor cells.</TITLE>The Notch signaling pathway is a multifunctional, evolutionarily conserved pathway, which plays an important role in development as well as stem cell biology. Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) represent a unique stem cell population, which is capable of differentiating into cell types of the ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages in vitro, and contribute to most somatic cell types in vivo. Our aim was to characterize the gene expression of Notch signaling elements in rodent MAPCs. We show that transcripts for Notch-receptors, ligands, regulatory molecules of the pathway and the Hairy/Enhancer of Split-1 (HES-1) target gene are present in mouse and rat low-Oct4 MAPCs. We found that mouse Notch3 and rat Notch1 transcripts increased when cells were cultured at high density for 48 to 96 hours. HES-1 and HES-related transcription factor-1 (HERP-1), transcriptional targets of Notch-signaling, were both elicited by immobilized Delta1 ligand. In addition, mRNA for Notch1 and Notch3 was also induced by Notch-signaling, suggesting the presence of regulatory feedback loops. Slight differences between mouse and rat derived MAPCs suggest that the exact function, transcriptional regulation and the fine-tuning of the signal may be species specific. Taken together, we characterized the gene expression profile of the Notch pathway in rodent low-Oct4-MAPCs, and showed that the pathway is functional and can be modulated. Our results provide an additional tool and a further basis for a better understanding of stem cell biology.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Patients then underwent hepatectomy with routine intra-operative ultrasonography (IOUS) and resected specimens were sent for histopathology. Pathology findings were compared with those of MRI scans to determine the sensitivity of this imaging modality. Exclusions were patients undergoing hepatic resection more than 4 weeks after the MRI scan, those undergoing chemotherapy at the time of the scan, and those with conglomerate unilobar metastases.|Complete data were available for 84 patients. There was total agreement between MRI, IOUS and histology in 79 patients (101 metastases). MRI missed 5 metastases in 5 patients that were found on IOUS (or palpation of superficial lesions) and subsequently confirmed by histological examination. These measured 5 mm or less (4 patients) and 7 mm (one patient). The sensitivity of MRI in the detection of colorectal liver metastases was thus 94% for all lesions and 100% for lesions 1 cm or larger in diameter.|MRI of the liver is a non-invasive technique with an extremely high degree of sensitivity in the detection of colorectal liver metastases and should be considered as the 'gold standard' in the pre-operative imaging of these patients.

Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory factors. Angiogenic factors have been the focus of intense research since the prospects of new therapeutic approaches seemed enormous. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has emerged as the most potent and most specific growth factor for endothelial cells and therefore a relevant target for novel anticancer therapy. A wide range of agents have been designed for their ability to interfere the VEGF signalling pathway. In addition, several drugs are currently in advanced clinical development. This review describes the current experimental strategies to inhibit VEGF and will also summarize and discuss the results of recent clinical trials involving anti-VEGF compounds either as standalone therapy or in combination with chemotherapy in lung cancer.

18245015	<TITLE>Peripheral blood dendritic cell subsets from patients with monoclonal gammopathies show an abnormal distribution and are functionally impaired.</TITLE>Objectives. The information currently available about dendritic cells (DCs) in patients with different types of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is limited and frequently controversial. In the present study, we analyzed the ex vivo distribution as well as the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood (PB) DCs from different types of MG. Methods. For this purpose, 61 untreated patients in total with MG were analyzed-MG of undetermined significance (MGUS), 29 cases; multiple myeloma (MM), 28 cases; and plasma cell leukemia (PCL), 4 cases-in comparison with a group of 10 healthy controls. Results. Our results show an absolute overall higher number of all subsets of PB DCs in PCL, together with lower numbers of myeloid DCs in MM patients. From a phenotypic point of view, PB DC subsets from all types of MG expressed significantly higher levels of HLA molecules and altered patterns of expression of the CD2, CD11c, CD16, CD22, CD62L, and CD86 molecules, in association with altered patterns of secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion. In summary, we show the existence of significant abnormalities in the distribution, phenotype, and pattern of secretion of inflammatory cytokines by different subsets of PB DCs from patients with MGs, which could reflect a potentially altered homing of DCs, together with a greater in vivo activation and lower responsiveness of PB DCs, which are already detectable in MGUS patients.

While methyl uguenenoate and the furoquinoline alkaloids displayed mild antimalarial activity, the azole and amide were completely inactive.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18355040	<TITLE>Structural analysis of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens.</TITLE>ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc PPase) catalyzes the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate and ATP to ADP-glucose and pyrophosphate. As a key step in glucan synthesis, the ADPGlc PPases are highly regulated by allosteric activators and inhibitors in accord with the carbon metabolism pathways of the organism. Crystals of Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADPGlc PPase were obtained using lithium sulfate as a precipitant. A complete anomalous selenomethionyl derivative X-ray diffraction data set was collected with unit cell dimensions a = 85.38 A, b = 93.79 A, and c = 140.29 A (alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees ) and space group I 222. The A. tumefaciens ADPGlc PPase model was refined to 2.1 A with an R factor = 22% and R free = 26.6%. The model consists of two domains: an N-terminal alphabetaalpha sandwich and a C-terminal parallel beta-helix. ATP and glucose 1-phosphate were successfully modeled in the proposed active site, and site-directed mutagenesis of conserved glycines in this region (G20, G21, and G23) resulted in substantial loss of activity. The interface between the N- and the C-terminal domains harbors a strong sulfate-binding site, and kinetic studies revealed that sulfate is a competitive inhibitor for the allosteric activator fructose 6-phosphate. These results suggest that the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains binds the allosteric regulator, and fructose 6-phosphate was modeled into this region. The A. tumefaciens ADPGlc PPase/fructose 6-phosphate structural model along with sequence alignment analysis was used to design mutagenesis experiments to expand the activator specificity to include fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The H379R and H379K enzymes were found to be activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

For thin tissue sections the anisotropy from normal tissue was found to be smaller compared with that from malignant tissue. However, the opposite result was obtained for thicker tissues. A phenomenological model was also developed to simulate the dependence of anisotropy on tissue thickness.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18385333	<TITLE>A rate code for sound azimuth in monkey auditory cortex: implications for human neuroimaging studies.</TITLE>Is sound location represented in the auditory cortex of humans and monkeys? Human neuroimaging experiments have had only mixed success at demonstrating sound location sensitivity in primary auditory cortex. This is in apparent conflict with studies in monkeys and other animals, in which single-unit recording studies have found stronger evidence for spatial sensitivity. Does this apparent discrepancy reflect a difference between humans and animals, or does it reflect differences in the sensitivity of the methods used for assessing the representation of sound location? The sensitivity of imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging depends on the following two key aspects of the underlying neuronal population: (1) what kind of spatial sensitivity individual neurons exhibit and (2) whether neurons with similar response preferences are clustered within the brain. To address this question, we conducted a single-unit recording study in monkeys. We investigated the nature of spatial sensitivity in individual auditory cortical neurons to determine whether they have receptive fields (place code) or monotonic (rate code) sensitivity to sound azimuth. Second, we tested how strongly the population of neurons favors contralateral locations. We report here that the majority of neurons show predominantly monotonic azimuthal sensitivity, forming a rate code for sound azimuth, but that at the population level the degree of contralaterality is modest. This suggests that the weakness of the evidence for spatial sensitivity in human neuroimaging studies of auditory cortex may be attributable to limited lateralization at the population level, despite what may be considerable spatial sensitivity in individual neurons.

18424963	<TITLE>Image-guided lateral suboccipital approach: part 1-individualized landmarks for surgical planning.</TITLE>Being situated close to the transverse and sigmoid sinus, the asterion has traditionally been viewed as a landmark for surgical approaches to the posterior fossa. Cadaveric studies, however, have shown its variability in relation to underlying anatomic structures. We have used an image-guidance technology to determine the precise anatomic relationship between the asterion and the underlying transverse-sigmoid sinus transition (TST) complex in patients scheduled for posterior fossa surgery. The applicability of three-dimensional (3-D) volumetric image-rendering for presurgical anatomic identification and individualization of a surgical landmark was evaluated.|One-millimeter computed tomographic slices were combined with venous computed tomographic angiography in 100 patients, allowing for 3-D volumetric image-rendering of the cranial bone and the dural vasculature at the same time. The spatial relationship between the asterion and the TST was recorded bilaterally by using opacity modulation of the bony surface. The location of both the asterion and the TST could be confirmed during surgery in all of these patients.|It was possible to accurately visualize the asterion and the sinuses in a single volumetrically rendered 3-D image in more than 90% of the patients. The variability in the anatomic position of the asterion as shown in cadaveric studies was confirmed, providing an individualized landmark for the patients. In this series, the asterion was located from 2 mm medial to 7 mm lateral and from 10 mm inferior to 17 mm superior to the TST, respectively.|Volumetric image-rendering allows for precise in vivo measurements of anatomic distances in 3-D space. It is also a valuable tool for assessing the validity of traditional surgical landmarks and individualizing them for surgical planning.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18511877	<TITLE>Immunohistochemical study of glypican 3 in thyroid cancer.</TITLE>In 123 patients with thyroid cancer, expression of glypican 3 (GPC3) was immunohistochemically investigated in tissue samples and the biological significance of GPC3 in thyroid cancer was examined. GPC3 was scarcely expressed in the normal thyroid gland, but was dramatically enhanced in certain types of cancers: 100% in follicular carcinoma (20/20 cases) and 70% in papillary carcinoma (48/69 cases). Expression of GPC3 in follicular carcinoma was significantly higher than that of follicular adenoma (p < 0.0019). In contrast, GPC 3 was not expressed in 17 cases of anaplastic carcinoma. A high expression of GPC3 mRNA was confirmed in cancer lesions, which were strongly positive for immunohistochemical staining. In 69 cases of papillary carcinoma, GPC3 was expressed at an early stage, suggesting that GPC3 expression in thyroid cancer is an early event in developing papillary carcinoma. Further studies are required to determine biological functions and molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation of GPC3 in thyroid cancer.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18562036	<TITLE>A novel preparation method for PLGA microspheres using non-halogenated solvents.</TITLE>We investigated a new preparation method for microspheres based on an Oil/Water type emulsion solvent evaporation method using non-halogenated solvents. This method is based on phase separation between acetone and aqueous glycerol. For the preparation of microspheres by this method, a solution of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) in acetone and aqueous glycerol containing poly(vinyl alcohol) were used asthe dispersed and continuous phases in the emulsification process, respectively. Vitamin B12 was used as the model drug. The formation of PLGA microspheres was observed above 60% glycerol in the continuous phase. The yield and encapsulation efficiency of the PLGA microspheres was about 80%, which was the maximum yield obtained with 70% glycerol. The release of vitamin B12 lasted for three weeks.

18563654	<TITLE>Zymomonas mobilis as catalyst for the biotechnological production of sorbitol and gluconic acid.</TITLE>The conversion of glucose and fructose into gluconic acid (GA) and sorbitol (SOR) was conducted in a batch reactor with free (CTAB-treated or not) or immobilized cells of Zymomonas mobilis. High yields (more than 90%) of gluconic acid and sorbitol were attained at initial substrate concentration of 600 g/L (glucose plus fructose at 1:1 ratio), using cells with glucose-fructose-oxidoreductase activity of 75 U/L. The concentration of the products varied hyperbolically with time according to the equations (GA)=t(GA)(max)/(W(GA) +t), (SOR)=t (SOR)(max)/(W(Sor)+t), v(GA)=[W(GA) (GA)(max)]/(W(GA)+t)(2) and V(SOR)=[W(SOR) (SOR)(max)]/(W(SOR)+t)(2). Taking the test carried out with free CTAB-treated cells as an example, the constant parameters were (GA)(max)= 541 g/L, (SOR)(max)=552 g/L, W(GA)=4.8h, W(SOR)=4.9h, upsilon(GA)=112.7 g/L. and upsilon(SOR)=112.7 g/L.

Millions of exquisitely uniform and precisely spaced nanostructures with designed surface chemistry can be rapidly produced using vapor deposition through mesoparticle masks. Nanoscopic amounts of water are essential for initiating surface hydrosilation. Thus, the key step for preparing covalently bonded nanostructures of organosilanes is to control drying parameters to spatially direct the placement of water on surfaces.

18643278	<TITLE>Adsorption kinetics of a single polymer on a solid plane.</TITLE>We study analytically and by means of an off-lattice bead-spring dynamic Monte Carlo simulation model the adsorption kinetics of a single macromolecule on a structureless flat substrate in the regime of strong physisorption. The underlying notion of a "stem-flower" polymer conformation, and the related mechanism of "zipping" during the adsorption process are shown to lead to a Fokker-Planck equation with reflecting boundary conditions for the time-dependent probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of adsorbed monomers. The theoretical treatment predicts that the mean fraction of adsorbed segments grows with time as a power law with a power of (1+nu)-1, where nu approximately 3/5 is the Flory exponent. The instantaneous distribution of train lengths is predicted to follow an exponential relationship. The corresponding PDFs for loops and tails are also derived. The complete solution for the time-dependent PDF of the number of adsorbed monomers is obtained numerically from the set of discrete coupled differential equations and shown to be in perfect agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation results. In addition to homopolymer adsorption, we also study regular multiblock copolymers and random copolymers, and demonstrate that their adsorption kinetics may be considered within the same theoretical model.

18693006	<TITLE>Tar removal during the fluidized bed gasification of plastic waste.</TITLE>A recycled polyethylene was fed in a pilot plant bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, having an internal diameter of 0.381 m and a maximum feeding capacity of 90 kg/h. The experimental runs were carried out under various operating conditions: the bed temperature was kept at about 850 degrees C, the equivalence ratio varied between 0.2 and 0.35, the amount of bed material was between 131 and 215 kg, the fluidizing velocity was between 0.5 and 0.7 m/s, quartz sand and olivine were used as bed material, and air and steam were used as fluidizing reactants. The results confirm that the tar removal treatments applied inside the gasifier (primary methods) can eliminate or strongly reduce the need for a further downstream cleanup of the syngas. In particular, the utilization of a natural olivine as an in situ tar reduction agent remarkably improves the quality of the product gas, in terms of both high hydrogen volumetric fraction and larger syngas yield.

18701531	<TITLE>Validity of three accelerometers during treadmill walking and motor vehicle travel.</TITLE>To determine the relative accuracy during treadmill walking and motor vehicle travel of the ActivPAL, PALlite and Digi-Walker accelerometers.|Forty healthy volunteers wearing all accelerometers undertook either five treadmill walks (n=20) at speeds ranging between 0.6 and 1.4 m/s or a 15 min motor vehicle journey (n=20). Step counts recorded by each accelerometer were compared with the actual step count determined by video analysis (treadmill walking) or with an actual step count of zero (motor vehicle). Mean percentage measurement error was calculated and compared between devices by one-way ANOVA and Student t test.|For treadmill walking, the measurement error was lowest for the ActivPAL, with no significant differences between the ActivPAL and the PALlite monitors. The measurement error was significantly higher for the Digi-Walker at speeds of < or =1 m/s. During vehicle travel erroneous steps were recorded by the PALlite (254 steps) and Digi-Walker (25 steps), but not the ActivPAL monitor (0 steps).|The ActivPAL accelerometer accurately measures step count over a range of walking speeds and, unlike the other accelerometers tested, is not falsely triggered by motor vehicle travel.

However, the mechanism of syrinx development is still poorly understood. Furthermore, the outcomes of current surgical procedures have been variable. There is evidence that the syringomyelia can spontaneously resolve, and this may warrant a more conservative approach to monitor the progression of neurological deficits. In this paper, we present a patient with spontaneous regression of syringomyelia. The current aetiological theories are discussed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18729596	<TITLE>Laminar cortical dynamics of cognitive and motor working memory, sequence learning and performance: toward a unified theory of how the cerebral cortex works.</TITLE>How does the brain carry out working memory storage, categorization, and voluntary performance of event sequences? The LIST PARSE neural model proposes an answer that unifies the explanation of cognitive, neurophysiological, and anatomical data. It quantitatively simulates human cognitive data about immediate serial recall and free recall, and monkey neurophysiological data from the prefrontal cortex obtained during sequential sensory-motor imitation and planned performance. The model clarifies why spatial and non-spatial working memories share the same type of circuit design. It proposes how laminar circuits of lateral prefrontal cortex carry out working memory storage of event sequences within layers 6 and 4, how these event sequences are unitized through learning into list chunks within layer 2/3, and how these stored sequences can be recalled at variable rates that are under volitional control by the basal ganglia. These laminar prefrontal circuits are variations of visual cortical circuits that explained data about how the brain sees. These examples from visual and prefrontal cortex illustrate how laminar neocortex can represent both spatial and temporal information, and open the way towards understanding how other behaviors derive from shared laminar neocortical designs.

18752834	<TITLE>Comparison of GC-MS and FTIR methods for quantifying naphthenic acids in water samples.</TITLE>The extraction of bitumen from the oil sands in Canada releases toxic naphthenic acids into the process-affected waters. The development of an ideal analytical method for quantifying naphthenic acids (general formula C(n)H(2n+Z)O(2)) has been impeded by the complexity of these mixtures and the challenges of differentiating naphthenic acids from other naturally-occurring organic acids. The oil sands industry standard FTIR method was compared with a newly-developed GC-MS method. Naphthenic acids concentrations were measured in extracts of surface and ground waters from locations within the vicinity of and away from the oil sands deposits and in extracts of process-affected waters. In all but one case, FTIR measurements of naphthenic acids concentrations were greater than those determined by GC-MS. The detection limit of the GC-MS method was 0.01 mg L(-1) compared to 1 mg L(-1) for the FTIR method. The results indicated that the GC-MS method is more selective for naphthenic acids, and that the FTIR method overestimates their concentrations.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Existing as well as new serum creatinine assay standards were used.|A PubMed literature search for all English-language articles published before November 2007 was conducted using the terms estimated glomerular filtration, GFR, modified diet in renal disease, MDRD, creatinine clearance, CrCl, drug dosing adjustment, renal impairment, human, and elderly. Mathematical comparisons of the age, race, and sex factors for these 2 equations (CG(CrCl)-Eq and MDRD) were performed, as well as a simulation of resulting values from these equations using various combinations of age, weight, and sex factors.|None of the articles identified found that the use of the MDRD equation in the elderly was better than the CG(CrCl)-Eq for estimating renal drug elimination. Substantial mathematical differences are inherent in these 2 prediction equations that make any clinical comparison quite difficult. Implementation of new creatinine assay standards will further confuse the use of these 2 equations for estimating GFR and for dosage adjustments in elderly patients with renal insufficiency.|Although an MDRD equation may be useful for estimating GFR, the CG(CrCl)-Eq should still be used for drug dosage adjustments. The CG(CrCl)-Eq may require a slight "adjustment factor" to be applied using serum creatinine values measured by newly established assay procedures.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
18970290	<TITLE>Statistical evaluation of recovery of 3,4-dichloroaniline in soil as function of particle size and analyte concentration.</TITLE>A great mean value of recovery for extraction of 3,4-dichloroaniline from a soil is calculated from individual recovery values evaluated for four different fractions of the soil. Then the uncertainty associated to this great mean recovery is calculated and used to know whether to apply or not the correction in routine analysis performed for the same kind of soil and the same analyte. The most representative fractions that, as a function of particle size, can be identified in a soil are: sand (2.000-0.063mm), coarse silt (0.063-0.020mm), fine silt (0.020-0.002mm) and clay (</=0.002mm). These fractions are here considered as sub matrices of the matrix soil. To evaluate the mean recovery and its uncertainty, as a function of the sub matrix and the analyte concentration, the four blank soil fractions were spiked with the analyte at three concentration levels (10.0, 50.0 and 100.0mg/kg) and three replicates were performed for each experiment. The 36 samples were extracted by accelerated solvent system and the amounts of 3,4-dichloroaniline were determined by RP-HPLC analysis. From the 36 individual recovery values, the great mean and its uncertainty are calculated. Experiments performed on samples of soil of similar composition, spiked with known concentrations of the same analyte showed the goodness of the mean recovery value.

19068099	<TITLE>Type II fatty acid synthesis is essential only for malaria parasite late liver stage development.</TITLE>Intracellular malaria parasites require lipids for growth and replication. They possess a prokaryotic type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway that localizes to the apicoplast plastid organelle and is assumed to be necessary for pathogenic blood stage replication. However, the importance of FAS II throughout the complex parasite life cycle remains unknown. We show in a rodent malaria model that FAS II enzymes localize to the sporozoite and liver stage apicoplast. Targeted deletion of FabB/F, a critical enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, did not affect parasite blood stage replication, mosquito stage development and initial infection in the liver. This was confirmed by knockout of FabZ, another critical FAS II enzyme. However, FAS II-deficient Plasmodium yoelii liver stages failed to form exo-erythrocytic merozoites, the invasive stage that first initiates blood stage infection. Furthermore, deletion of FabI in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum did not show a reduction in asexual blood stage replication in vitro. Malaria parasites therefore depend on the intrinsic FAS II pathway only at one specific life cycle transition point, from liver to blood.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We describe a case, in a 55-year-old Caucasian female, who developed a swelling in the left posterior hard palate. Bony involvement was absent. Importantly, the medical history was positive for a previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Following incisional biopsy, histological examination revealed a vaguely nodular lymphoid proliferation composed of small well-differentiated lymphocytes. The lymphoid follicles were positive for CD20, CD79a, CD10, CD21 and BCL6, while negative for BCL2. The parafollicular areas revealed positivity for CD3, CD5, CD30, and CD15. Both areas were CD45 positive. Subsequent immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement analysis revealed a polyclonal lesion. No further treatment was instituted, and the patient is currently being followed-up every three months. This report demonstrates that FLHs are especially important due to their clinical and, occasionally, microscopic resemblance to follicular lymphomas. Morphologic and immunohistochemical analyses and molecular studies are essential to achieve accurate diagnosis and to implement appropriate management.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
19155512	<TITLE>The critical role of epithelial-derived Act1 in IL-17- and IL-25-mediated pulmonary inflammation.</TITLE>IL-25 initiates, promotes, and augments Th2 immune responses. In this study, we report that Act1, a key component in IL-17-mediated signaling, is an essential signaling molecule for IL-25 signaling. Although Act1-deficient mice showed reduced expression of KC (CXCL1) and neutrophil recruitment to the airway compared with wild-type mice in response to IL-17 stimulation, Act1 deficiency abolished IL-25-induced expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin-1 (CCL11), and pulmonary eosinophilia. Using a mouse model of allergic pulmonary inflammation, we observed diminished Th2 responses and lung inflammation in Act1-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Importantly, Act1 deficiency in epithelial cells reduced the phenotype of allergic pulmonary inflammation due to loss of IL-17-induced neutrophilia and IL-25-induced eosinophilia, respectively. These results demonstrate the essential role of epithelial-derived Act1 in allergic pulmonary inflammation through the distinct impact of the IL-17R-Act1 and IL-25R-Act1 axes. Such findings are crucial for the understanding of pathobiology of atopic diseases, including allergic asthma, which identifies Act1 as a potential therapeutic target.

Results were compared among 4 ELBW cohorts (87 of 89 children born in 1979-1980, 206 of 212 born in 1985-1987, 224 of 241 born in 1991-1992, and 160 of 170 born in 1997), and between each of these ELBW cohorts and normal birth weight (NBW; birth weight > 2499 g) controls.|The survival rate for ELBW children rose from 25% for the 1979-1980 cohort to 73% for the 1997 cohort. No statistically significant differences in the disability rates were seen in the 4 eras; however, in the 1997 cohort, disability rates were significantly higher in the ELBW children compared with NBW controls: mild disability, 36.7% vs 9.8%; moderate disability, 10.1% vs 2.3%; and severe disability, 8.2% vs 0.6%.|The survival rate of ELBW children continues to rise over time.

The hierarchical approach produces more plausible, more stable estimates than the conventional approach, while adjusting for potential confounding by other nutrients.|Analyses included 386 cases and 408 nonmalformed controls with complete data on nutrients and potential confounders (race/ethnicity, education, obesity, and intake of vitamin supplements) from a population-based case-control study of deliveries in California from 1989 to 1991. Nutrients were specified as continuous, and their units were standardized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation (SD) of 1 for comparability of units across pathways. ORs reflect a 1-SD increase in the corresponding nutrient.|Among women who took vitamin supplements, semi-Bayesian hierarchical modeling results suggested no associations between nutrient intake and NTDs. Among women who did not take supplements, both conventional and hierarchical models (HM) suggested an inverse association between lutein intake and NTD risk (HM odds ratio [OR] = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.5-0.9) and a positive association with sucrose (HM OR 1.4; 1.1-1.8) and glycemic index (HM OR 1.3; 1.0-1.6).|Our findings for lutein, glycemic index, and sucrose suggest that further study of NTDs and the glycemic control and oxidative stress pathways is warranted.

The role of carboxylesterase (CES) in MMF hydrolysis was examined in vitro using human liver microsomes. V(max) and K(m) values of MMF hydrolysis in pooled human liver microsomes were 1368 +/- 44 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein and 1030 +/- 65 microM, respectively. Hydrolytic activity was inhibited by the CES inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, bis-p-nitorophenylphosphate and diisopropylfluorophosphate, with IC(50) values of 77.1, 3.59 and 0.0312 microM, respectively. Eighty Japanese renal transplant recipients that received repeated-doses of MMF, tacrolimus and prednisolone,were evaluated for MPA pharmacokinetics 28 days after transplantation to investigate the relationship between MPA pharmacokinetics and CES2 genetic polymorphisms. No significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetics were observed between CES2 A4595G, C8721T orA-1548G genotype groups. CES2 allelic variants also did not appear to affect plasma MPA concentrations between individuals. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that while CES1 and/or CES2 are involved in the hydrolysis of MMF to MPA, CES2 allelic variants appeared to make only a minor contribution to inter-personal differences in MPA pharmacokinetics.

19274654	<TITLE>Universal nuclear domains of somatic and germ cells: some lessons from oocyte interchromatin granule cluster and Cajal body structure and molecular composition.</TITLE>It is now clear that two prominent nuclear domains, interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs) and Cajal bodies (CBs), contribute to the highly ordered organization of the extrachromosomal space of the cell nucleus. These functional domains represent structurally stable but highly dynamic nuclear organelles enriched in factors that are required for different nuclear activities, especially RNA biogenesis. IGCs are considered to be the main sites for storage, assembly, and/or recycling of the essential spliceosome components. CBs are involved in the biogenesis of several classes of small RNPs as well as the modification of newly assembled small nuclear RNA. We have summarized data on the molecular composition, structure, and functional roles of IGCs and CBs in the nuclei of mammalian somatic cells and oocytes of some animals with a special focus on insects. We have focused on similarities and differences between the IGCs and CBs of oocytes and the well-studied CBs and IGCs of cultured mammalian somatic cells. We have shown the heterogeneous character of oocyte IGCs and CBs, both in structure and molecular content. We have also demonstrated the unique capacity of oocytes to form close structural interactions between IGC and CB components. We proposed to consider these joint structures as integrated entities, sharing the features of both IGCs and CBs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

To do so, melatonin levels were firstly measured in eyecups and plasma to determine circadian patterns of melatonin production. Secondly, the effect of partial ophthalmectomy on the suppression of melatonin production was determined in vivo as well as ex vivo pineal light/dark sensitivity. Finally, to investigate whether such findings could be related to post-surgery stress, melatonin analyses were performed in the subsequent 24 h and 7 days post-ophthalmectomy with cortisol levels assessed as an indicator of stress. Our results showed an inverse pattern of melatonin production in the eye cups of tilapia compared to blood circulating levels, suggesting different roles played by melatonin in these two tissues. Results then demonstrated that total or partial ophthalmectomy resulted in the suppression of night-time melatonin production. Furthermore, although pineals in culture were shown to be photosensitive, night-time melatonin levels were much lower than seen in other species. Finally, when performing sampling immediately or one week post-surgery, no difference in the melatonin profiles were observed. It is therefore unlikely that post-surgery stress would explain such suppression in melatonin production although all fish displayed high cortisol levels most probably due to social and handling stress. Taken together, these results provide further evidence of a new type of circadian organisation in a teleost species where the eyes are required to sustain night-time melatonin levels.

19415399	<TITLE>Changes in inflammatory biomarkers across weight classes in a representative US population: a link between obesity and inflammation.</TITLE>Obesity has been linked with a chronic state of inflammation which may be involved in the development of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and even cancer. The objective of this study was to examine the association between obesity class and levels of inflammatory biomarkers from men and women who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).|Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were measured among US participants of the 1999-2004 NHANES. We examined biomarker levels across different weight classes with normal weight, overweight, and obesity classes 1, 2, and 3 were defined as BMI of < 25.0, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9, and > or = 40.0, respectively.|With CRP levels for normal weight individuals as a reference, CRP levels nearly doubled with each increase in weight class: +0.11 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.06-0.16) for overweight, +0.21 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.16-0.27) for obesity class 1, +0.43 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.26-0.61) for obesity class 2, and +0.73 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.55-0.90) for obesity class 3. With normal weight individuals as a reference, fibrinogen levels increase with increasing weight class and were highest for obesity class 3 individuals, +93.5 mg/dl (95% CI, 72.9-114.1). Individuals with hypertension or diabetes have higher levels of CRP and fibrinogen levels compared to individuals without hypertension or diabetes, even when stratified according to BMI.|There is a direct association between increasing obesity class and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers.

19535951	<TITLE>Hypothermia after cardiac arrest: expanding the therapeutic scope.</TITLE>Therapeutic hypothermia for 12 to 24 hrs following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is now recommended by the American Heart Association for the treatment of neurological injury when the initial cardiac rhythm is ventricular fibrillation. However, the role of therapeutic hypothermia is uncertain when the initial cardiac rhythm is asystole or pulseless electrical activity, or when the cardiac arrest is primarily due to a noncardiac cause, such as asphyxia or drug overdose. Given that survival rate in these latter conditions is very low, it is unlikely that clinical trials will be undertaken to test the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in this setting because of the very large sample size that would be required to detect a significant difference in outcomes. Therefore, in patients with anoxic brain injury after nonventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, clinicians will need to balance the possible benefit of therapeutic hypothermia with the possible side effects of this therapy. Given that the side effects of therapeutic hypothermia are generally easily managed in the critical care setting, and there is benefit for anoxic brain injury demonstrated in laboratory studies, consideration may be given to treat comatose post-cardiac arrest patients with therapeutic hypothermia in this setting. Because the induction of therapeutic hypothermia has become more feasible with the development of simple intravenous cooling techniques and specialized equipment for improved temperature control in the critical care unit, it is expected that therapeutic hypothermia will become more widely used in the management of anoxic neurological injury whatever the presenting cardiac rhythm.

19538654	<TITLE>Organizational correlates of secondary traumatic stress and burnout among sexual assault nurse examiners.</TITLE>This study explores correlates of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout among SANE nurses. Cross-sectional interviews were conducted with nurses from a random sample of SANE programs. The interview measured organizational and demographic variables and current levels of STS and burnout. STS and burnout were found to be related but not identical processes. Organizational variables played a significant role in predicting both outcomes. The results have implications for increasing organizational support as a way of lessening the impact of STS and burnout.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
19553054	<TITLE>In vivo structural analysis of articular cartilage using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.</TITLE>The articular cartilage is a small tissue with a matrix structure of three layers between which the orientation of collagen fiber differs. A diffusion-weighted twice-refocused spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence was optimized for the articular cartilage, and the structure of the three layers of human articular cartilage was imaged in vivo from diffusion tensor images.|The subjects imaged were five specimens of swine femur head after removal of the flesh around the knee joint, five specimens of swine articular cartilage with flesh present and the knee cartilage of five adult male volunteers. Based on diffusion-weighted images in six directions, the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated.|Diffusion tensor images of the articular cartilage were obtained by sequence optimization. The MD and FA value of the specimens (each of five examples) under different conditions were estimated. Although the articular cartilage is a small tissue, the matrix structure of each layer in the articular cartilage was obtained by SE-EPI sequence with GRAPPA. The MD and FA values of swine articular cartilage are different between the synovial fluid and saline. In human articular cartilage, the load of the body weight on the knee had an effect on the FA value of the surface layer of the articular cartilage.|This method can be used to create images of the articular cartilage structure, not only in vitro but also in vivo. Therefore, it is suggested that this method should support the elucidation of the in vivo structure and function of the knee joint and might be applied to clinical practice.

19594320	<TITLE>Changing structure of the femoral neck across the adult female lifespan.</TITLE>The anatomic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone in the femoral neck may be critical in determining resistance to fracture. We investigated the effects of aging on femoral neck bone in women. In this cross-sectional study, we used clinical multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) of the hips to investigate aging effects in 100 female volunteers aged 20 to 90 years. We developed a clinically efficient protocol to measure cortical thickness (C.Th) and cortical, trabecular, and integral bone mineral density (CtBMD, TrBMD, and iBMD in mg/cm(3)) in anatomic quadrants of the femoral neck. We used a nested ANOVA to evaluate their associations with height, weight, location in the femoral neck, and age of the subject. Age was the principal determinant of both cortical thickness and BMD. Age had significantly different effects within the anatomic quadrants; compared with young women, elderly subjects had relative preservation of the inferoanterior (IA) quadrant but strikingly reduced C.Th and BMD superiorly. A model including height, weight, and region of interest (and their interactions) explained 83% of the measurement variance (p < .0001). There were marked C.Th and BMD differences between age 25 and age 85 in the already thin superior quadrants. At 25 years the predicted C.Th of the superoposterior quadrant was 1.63 mm, whereas at 85 years it was 0.33 mm [-1.33 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference over 60 years -1.69 to -0.95]. By contrast, at 25 years mean C.Th of the IA quadrant was 3.9 mm, whereas at 85 years it was 3.3 mm (-0.6 mm, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.10). CtBMD of the IA region was equivalent at 25 and 85 years. In conclusion, elderly women had relative preservation of IA femoral neck bone over seven decades compared with young women but markedly lower C.Th and BMD in the other three quadrants. The IA quadrant transmits mechanical load from walking. Mechanical theory and laboratory tests on cadaveric femurs suggest that localized bone loss may increase the risk of fracture in elderly fallers. It remains to be determined whether this MDCT technique can provide better prediction of hip fracture than conventional clinical dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

19608407	<TITLE>Gangliosides in cell recognition and membrane protein regulation.</TITLE>Gangliosides, sialic acid-bearing glycosphingolipids, are expressed on all vertebrate cells, and are the major glycans on nerve cells. They are anchored to the plasma membrane through their ceramide lipids with their varied glycans extending into the extracellular space. Through sugar-specific interactions with glycan-binding proteins on apposing cells, gangliosides function as receptors in cell-cell recognition, regulating natural killer cell cytotoxicity via Siglec-7, myelin-axon interactions via Siglec-4 (myelin-associated glycoprotein), and inflammation via E-selectin. Gangliosides also interact laterally in their own membranes, regulating the responsiveness of signaling proteins including the insulin, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. In these ways, gangliosides act as regulatory elements in the immune system, in the nervous system, in metabolic regulation, and in cancer progression.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
19684618	<TITLE>Protein lysate microarray analysis to identify microRNAs regulating estrogen receptor signaling in breast cancer cell lines.</TITLE>Predicting the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on target proteins is challenging because of their different regulatory effects at the transcriptional and translational levels. In this study, we applied a novel protein lysate microarray (LMA) technology to systematically monitor for target protein levels after high-throughput transfections of 319 pre-miRs into breast cancer cells. We identified 21 miRNAs that downregulated the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha), as validated by western blotting and quantitative real time-PCR, and by demonstrating the inhibition of estrogen-stimulated cell growth. Five potent ERalpha-regulating miRNAs, miR-18a, miR-18b, miR-193b, miR-206 and miR-302c, were confirmed to directly target ERalpha in 3'-untranslated region reporter assays. The gene expression signature that they repressed highly overlapped with that of a small interfering RNA against ERalpha, and across all the signatures tested, was most closely associated with the repression of known estrogen-induced genes. Furthermore, miR-18a and miR-18b showed higher levels of expression in ERalpha-negative as compared with ERalpha-positive clinical tumors. In summary, we present systematic and direct functional evidence of miRNAs inhibiting ERalpha signaling in breast cancer, and demonstrate the high-throughput LMA technology as a novel, powerful technique in determining the relative impact of various miRNAs on key target proteins and associated cellular processes and pathways.

19733277	<TITLE>Effects of onset of labor and mode of delivery on severe postpartum hemorrhage.</TITLE>Our purpose was to study the impact of labor onset and delivery mode on the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage.|This was a population-based study of 307,415 mothers who were registered in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway from 1999-2004.|Severe postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% of all mothers and in 2.1% of those mothers with previous cesarean section delivery (CS). Compared with spontaneous labor, hemorrhage risk was higher for induction (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-1.88) and prelabor CS (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.84-2.29). The risk was 55% higher for emergency CS and half that for vaginal deliveries (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.43-0.53), compared with prelabor CS. The highest risk was for emergency CS after induction in mothers with previous CS (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 4.25-10.13), compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery in mothers with no previous CS.|Induction and prelabor CS should be practiced with caution because of the increased risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage.

19783315	<TITLE>Transgenic plants as vital components of integrated pest management.</TITLE>Although integrated pest management (IPM) strategies have been developed worldwide, further improvement of IPM effectiveness is required. The use of transgenic technology to create insect-resistant plants can offer a solution to the limited availability of highly insect-resistant cultivars. Commercially available insect-resistant transgenic crops show clear benefits for agriculture and there are many exciting new developments such as transgenic plants that enhance biological control. Effective evaluation tools are needed to ascertain that transgenic plants do not result in undesired non-target effects. If these conditions are met, there will be ample opportunities for transgenic plants to become key components of environmentally benign and durable pest management systems. Here we discuss the potential and challenges for incorporating transgenic plants in IPM.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
19881440	<TITLE>Interventions that affect gender bias in hiring: a systematic review.</TITLE>To systematically review experimental evidence for interventions mitigating gender bias in employment. Unconscious endorsement of gender stereotypes can undermine academic medicine's commitment to gender equity.|The authors performed electronic and hand searches for randomized controlled studies since 1973 of interventions that affect gender differences in evaluation of job applicants. Twenty-seven studies met all inclusion criteria. Interventions fell into three categories: application information, applicant features, and rating conditions.|The studies identified gender bias as the difference in ratings or perceptions of men and women with identical qualifications. Studies reaffirmed negative bias against women being evaluated for positions traditionally or predominantly held by men (male sex-typed jobs). The assessments of male and female raters rarely differed. Interventions that provided raters with clear evidence of job-relevant competencies were effective. However, clearly competent women were rated lower than equivalent men for male sex-typed jobs unless evidence of communal qualities was also provided. A commitment to the value of credentials before review of applicants and women's presence at above 25% of the applicant pool eliminated bias against women. Two studies found unconscious resistance to "antibias" training, which could be overcome with distraction or an intervening task. Explicit employment equity policies and an attractive appearance benefited men more than women, whereas repeated employment gaps were more detrimental to men. Masculine-scented perfume favored the hiring of both sexes. Negative bias occurred against women who expressed anger or who were perceived as self-promoting.|High-level evidence exists for strategies to mitigate gender bias in hiring.

19890176	<TITLE>A computerized, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate posttraumatic stress among firefighters after the World Trade Center collapse.</TITLE>We sought to determine the frequency of psychological symptoms and elevated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk among New York City firefighters after the World Trade Center (WTC) attack and whether these measures were associated with Counseling Services Unit (CSU) use or mental health-related medical leave over the first 2.5 years after the attack.|Shortly after the WTC attack, a computerized, binary-response screening questionnaire was administered. Exposure assessment included WTC arrival time and "loss of a co-worker while working at the collapse." We determined elevated PTSD risk using thresholds derived from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, and a sensitivity-specificity analysis.|Of 8487 participants, 76% reported at least 1 symptom, 1016 (12%) met criteria for elevated PTSD risk, and 2389 (28%) self-referred to the CSU, a 5-fold increase from before the attack. Higher scores were associated with CSU use, functional job impairment, and mental health-related medical leave. Exposure-response gradients were significant for all outcomes.|This screening tool effectively identified elevated PTSD risk, higher CSU use, and functional impairment among firefighters and therefore may be useful in allocating scarce postdisaster mental health resources.

19944376	<TITLE>Measuring nursing advocacy in procedural pain care--development and validation of an instrument.</TITLE>Nursing advocacy has been defined in several ways, but its structure has not been operationalized. Therefore, different theoretical aspects of advocacy have not been able to be verified empirically. Our aim was to validate the content and structure of the concept of nursing advocacy within procedural pain care from the point of view of both patients and nurses. The concept of nursing advocacy was outlined first by integrative literature review and then delineated with data of semi-structured interviews among adult internal medicine and surgical patients and nurses (phases I-II). Then, the instrument was developed with facet-design approach, and the content and construct validity of it established in two subsamples within otolaryngeal surgical care (phases III-V). These descriptive and explorative studies were conducted from 2003 to 2007 in a total of 12 Finnish hospitals. The findings supported the validity of both the concept and the instrument. Pearson correlations and Cronbach alphas supported the conceptual dimensions of advocacy operationalized in this instrument. Internal consistency validity of the instrument scales were supported by subscale CVI, which ranged from 0.97 to 0.99, and item CVI, which ranged from 0.93 to 1.00. The instrument structure was strengthened with exploratory factor analysis, which explained 65% (sample of patients) or 57% (sample of nurses) of the variance in antecedents, 75% or 74% of the variance in activities, and 60% or 56% of the variance in the consequences of advocacy. This four-part 56-item (58-item for nurses) instrument promises to measure the dimensions of nursing advocacy. However, the instrument needs further validation in different settings.

20004569	<TITLE>Production, characterization and application of activated carbon from brewer's spent grain lignin.</TITLE>Different types of activated carbon were prepared by chemical activation of brewer's spent grain (BSG) lignin using H(3)PO(4) at various acid/lignin ratios (1, 2, or 3g/g) and carbonization temperatures (300, 450, or 600 degrees C), according to a 2(2) full-factorial design. The resulting materials were characterized with regard to their surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution, and used for detoxification of BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate (a mixture of sugars, phenolic compounds, metallic ions, among other compounds). BSG carbons presented BET surface areas between 33 and 692 m(2)/g, and micro- and mesopores with volumes between 0.058 and 0.453 cm(3)/g. The carbons showed high capacity for adsorption of metallic ions, mainly nickel, iron, chromium, and silicon. The concentration of phenolic compounds and color were also reduced by these sorbents. These results suggest that activated carbons with characteristics similar to those commercially found and high adsorption capacity can be produced from BSG lignin.

20006929	<TITLE>Discovery of novel taspine derivatives as antiangiogenic agents.</TITLE>VEGFR-2 plays a critical role in vasculogenesis and inhibitors of VEGFR-2 could be used in the treatment of cancer. Taspine was one of the active ingredients screened by using an endothelial cell membrane chromatography and showed inhibition against VEGFR-2. In our research, we explored how the lactone ring and biphenyl scaffold in taspine influence its potent in vitro anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. Accordingly, we report the design, synthesis, and preliminary evaluation of four novel taspine derivatives as VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The preliminary biological test showed that one of the compounds showed much better inhibitory activities against CACO-2 (IC(50)=52.5nM) and ECV304 (IC(50)=2.67nM) than taspine. This result enlarges the interest in ring-opened taspine derivative skeleton in the search of new antiangiogenesis agents.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20088591	<TITLE>Metabolic fingerprint of Brazilian maize landraces silk (stigma/styles) using NMR spectroscopy and chemometric methods.</TITLE>Aqueous extract from maize silks is used by traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments, mainly related to the urinary system. This work focuses on the application of NMR spectroscopy and chemometric analysis for the determination of metabolic fingerprint and pattern recognition of silk extracts from seven maize landraces cultivated in southern Brazil. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the (1)H NMR data set showed clear discrimination among the maize varieties by PC1 and PC2, pointing out three distinct metabolic profiles. Target compounds analysis showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in the contents of protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, t-cinnamic acid, and anthocyanins, corroborating the discrimination of the genotypes in this study as revealed by PCA analysis. Thus the combination of (1)H NMR and PCA is a useful tool for the discrimination of maize silks in respect to their chemical composition, including rapid authentication of the raw material of current pharmacological interest.

20109441	<TITLE>Insect-specific irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase in pests including the bed bug, the eastern yellowjacket, German and American cockroaches, and the confused flour beetle.</TITLE>Insecticides directed against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are facing increased resistance among target species as well as increasing concerns for human toxicity. The result has been a resurgence of disease vectors, insects destructive to agriculture, and residential pests. We previously reported a free cysteine (Cys) residue at the entrance to the AChE active site in some insects but not higher vertebrates. We also reported Cys-targeting methanethiosulfonate molecules (AMTSn), which, under conditions that spared human AChE, caused total irreversible inhibition of aphid AChE, 95% inhibition of AChE from the malaria vector mosquito (Anopheles gambia), and >80% inhibition of activity from the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens). We now find the same compounds inhibit AChE from cockroaches (Blattella germanica and Periplaneta americana), the flour beetle (Tribolium confusum), the multi-colored Asian ladybird beetle (Harmonia axyridis), the bed bug (Cimex lectularius), and a wasp (Vespula maculifrons), with IC(50) values of approximately 1-11muM. Our results support further study of Cys-targeting inhibitors as conceptually novel insecticides that may be free of resistance in a range of insect pests and disease vectors and, compared with current compounds, should demonstrate much lower toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish.

20134005	<TITLE>Efficacy of waterless hand hygiene compared with handwashing with soap: a field study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</TITLE>Effective handwashing with soap requires reliable access to water supplies. However, more than three billion persons do not have household-level access to piped water. This research addresses the challenge of improving hand hygiene within water-constrained environments. The antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, a waterless hand hygiene product, was evaluated and compared with handwashing with soap and water in field conditions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Hand sanitizer use by mothers resulted in 0.66 and 0.64 log reductions per hand of Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, respectively. In comparison, handwashing with soap resulted in 0.50 and 0.25 log reductions per hand of E. coli and fecal streptococci, respectively. Hand sanitizer was significantly better than handwashing with respect to reduction in levels of fecal streptococci (P = 0.01). The feasibility and health impacts of promoting hand sanitizer as an alternative hand hygiene option for water-constrained environments should be assessed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20135325	<TITLE>Light screening in lichen cortices can be quantified by chlorophyll fluorescence techniques for both reflecting and absorbing pigments.</TITLE>Lichens, representing mutualistic symbioses between photobionts and mycobionts, often accumulate high concentrations of secondary compounds synthesized by the fungal partner. Light screening is one function for cortical compounds being deposited as crystals outside fungal hyphae. These compounds can non-destructively be extracted by 100% acetone from air-dry living thalli. Extraction of atranorin from Physcia aipolia changed the lichen colour from pale grey to green in the hydrated state, whereas acetone-rinsed and control thalli were all pale grey when dry. Removal of parietin from Xanthoria parietina changed the colour of desiccated thalli from orange to grey. Colour changes were quantified by reflectance measurements. By a new chlorophyll fluorescence method, screening was assessed as the decrease in incident irradiance (PAR) necessary to reach identical effective quantum yields of PSII (Phi(PSII)) in acetone-rinsed and control thalli. Thereby, we estimated a screening efficiency due to cortical atranorin crystals at 61, 38, and 40% of blue, green and red light, respectively, whereas parietin screened 81, 27 and 1% of these wavelength ranges. Removal of atranorin caused similar levels of increased photoinhibition for P. aipolia in blue, green and red light, whereas parietin-deficient thalli of X. parietina exhibited increased photoinhibition with decreasing wavelengths. Atranorin possibly prevents water from entering the spaces between the hyphae in the cortex. The air-filled cavities with white atranorin crystals reflect excess light, whereas the yellow compound parietin absorbs excess light. Thereby, both atranorin and parietin play significant photoprotective roles for symbiotic green algae, but with compound-specific screening mechanisms.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20138625	<TITLE>An electrochemically enhanced solid-phase microextraction approach based on a multi-walled carbon nanotubes/Nafion composite coating.</TITLE>In this paper, we proposed an approach using a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/Nafion composite coating as a working electrode for the electrochemically enhanced solid-phase microextraction (EE-SPME) of charged compounds. Suitable negative and positive potentials were applied to enhance the extraction of cationic (protonated amines) and anionic compounds (deprotonated carboxylic acids) in aqueous solutions, respectively. Compared to the direct SPME mode (DI-SPME) (without applying potential), the EE-SPME presented more effective and selective extraction of charged analytes primarily via electrophoresis and complementary charge interaction. The experimental parameters relating to extraction efficiency of the EE-SPME such as applied potentials, extraction time, ionic strength, sample pH were studied and optimized. The linear dynamic range of developed EE-SPME-GC for the selected amines spanned three orders of magnitude (0.005-1mugmL(-1)) with R(2) larger than 0.9933, and the limits of detection were in the range of 0.048-0.070ngmL(-1). All of these characteristics demonstrate that the proposed MWCNTs/Nafion EE-SPME is an efficient, flexible and versatile sampling and extraction tool which is ideally suited for use with chromatographic methods.

20142111	<TITLE>Finite element simulation of cell-substrate decohesion by laser-induced stress waves.</TITLE>Fundamental to the development and application of biomedical devices is an understanding of the adhesion of cells to substrates. There are many experimental techniques and papers dedicated to the study of cell adhesion. This work aims to elucidate on the cell detachment mechanism in a recently reported cell adhesion measurement experiment by laser-induced stress wave technique. In the experiment the absorption of an Nd:YAG laser pulse generates a stress wave of nanoseconds duration that interacts with and detaches the cell adhered to a Si substrate. Due to the ultra-short timescale involved in the experiment, details of the detachment process were not readily observable. In this work, dynamic finite element method is used to simulate the cell-substrate decohesion process under the laser-induced stress wave loading. The results show that the combined effect of nanosecond stress wave pulse and the specific cell geometry results in a complex stress-strain state along the cell-substrate interface. The principal failure mechanism is large interfacial strains realized from the cell's tendency to spread and elongate on the substrate as a result of substrate acceleration. The cells behave like a soft elastic solid during the detachment process due to the large difference between their characteristic response time and the ultra-short duration of the applied stress wave. Evolution of the cell geometry from hydrophobic to hydrophilic contact results in the same detachment process.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20156073	<TITLE>Antihypertensive treatment, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of ischemic heart disease mortality: a 16-year follow-up in the Copenhagen male study.</TITLE>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality among men taking antihypertensive medication.|This was a 16-year follow up of 2,986 men 53-75 years old without overt cardiovascular disease; 357 men used antihypertensive medicine. Potential risk factors were type of baseline medication, blood pressure, diabetes, fasting serum triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and total cholesterol, glucosuria, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, cancer history, body mass index, alcohol and tobacco use, leisure time physical activity, social class, and age. The main outcome was IHD mortality.|Men treated for hypertension had a two-fold higher cumulative incidence of IHD mortality during the follow up compared to other men (12.0% vs, 5.8%). Dyslipidemia was defined as TG >or=1.70 mmol/L or HDL-C <or=1.03 mmol/L. Among men without any dyslipidemia (n = 159 or 46%), in Cox analysis adjusted for age only, the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for IHD mortality was 1.2 (0.6-2.3) compared to untreated normotensives (n = 1,953). Among men with one dyslipidemia (n = 116 or 34%) HR was 2.2 (1.2-4.0), and among men with combined dyslipidemia (n = 71 or 20%) HR was 6.0 (3.5-10.2). Adjustment for relevant confounders attenuated the three HRs to 0.8 (0.4-1.7), 1.6 (0.9-3.1), and 4.5 (2.5-8.2), respectively. Measured blood pressure was not associated with IHD mortality risk among men on antihypertensive medication.|TG and HDL-C dyslipidemia were strong effect modifiers. Men on antihypertensive medication had no increased risk of IHD mortality compared to untreated normotensive men, provided they were free from high TG and low HDL-C dyslipidemia.

Oral vitamin D(3) was recommended in those with low baseline 25(OH)D levels. The relationship between changes in 25(OH)D levels from baseline and changes in fatigue (measured by a 0-10 visual analog scale [VAS]), SLE activity (measured by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index [SLEDAI]), and irreversible organ damage (measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI]) were analyzed.|Sixty patients took vitamin D(3). Mean 25(OH)D levels increased among all treated patients (P = 0.044), in those with baseline vitamin D levels <30 ng/ml (P < 0.001), and in those with baseline vitamin D levels <10 ng/ml (P = 0.005). Fifty-seven patients (71%) still had 25(OH)D levels <30 ng/ml and 5 (6%) had 25(OH)D levels <10 ng/ml. Inverse significant correlations between 25(OH)D levels and the VAS (P = 0.001) and between changes in 25(OH)D levels and changes in the VAS in patients with baseline 25(OH)D levels <30 ng/ml (P = 0.017) were found. No significant correlations were seen between the variation of the SLEDAI or SDI values and the variation in 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.87 and P = 0.63, respectively).|Increasing 25(OH)D levels may have a beneficial effect on fatigue. Our results do not support any effects of increasing 25(OH)D levels on SLE severity, although they are limited by the insufficient 25(OH)D response to the recommended regimen of oral vitamin D(3) replacement.

20298657	<TITLE>Caries-risk assessment and caries status of children with autism.</TITLE>This paper's purpose was to describe the caries status of children with autism and explore associations with the Caries-risk Assessment Tool promoted by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.|Data was collected from children with autism, their parents, and dentists using interviews, surveys, and treatment records. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis explored the association of new caries activity and caries experience with oral health measures.|Subjects were 75 males and 24 females with a mean age (+/-SD) of 9.7 years (+/-3.7), (range=2.7 to 19 years). Children < or =7 years old had more new caries (60%) than older children (34%; P=.05). Although not statistically significant, all children who brushed less than once per day had new caries and a mean t-DMF-T (def + DMF) of 73. Children with poor oral hygiene had more new caries (59%) than those with good/excellent hygiene (28%; P=.06). Caries status was not associated with gender, socioeconomic status, medical history, appointment type, dental home, food rewards, restricted diets, and some hygiene habits.|This study confirms the validity of considering autism as an indicator of high caries risk. Oral hygiene may be the most influential risk indicator associated with new caries in children with autism.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20331869	<TITLE>Bacteria in cancer therapy: a novel experimental strategy.</TITLE>Resistance to conventional anticancer therapies in patients with advanced solid tumors has prompted the need of alternative cancer therapies. Moreover, the success of novel cancer therapies depends on their selectivity for cancer cells with limited toxicity to normal tissues. Several decades after Coley's work a variety of natural and genetically modified non-pathogenic bacterial species are being explored as potential antitumor agents, either to provide direct tumoricidal effects or to deliver tumoricidal molecules. Live, attenuated or genetically modified non-pathogenic bacterial species are capable of multiplying selectively in tumors and inhibiting their growth. Due to their selectivity for tumor tissues, these bacteria and their spores also serve as ideal vectors for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumors. Bacterial toxins too have emerged as promising cancer treatment strategy. The most potential and promising strategy is bacteria based gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. Although it has shown successful results in vivo yet further investigation about the targeting mechanisms of the bacteria are required to make it a complete therapeutic approach in cancer treatment.

20365528	<TITLE>Divergent series and memory of the initial condition in the long-time solution of some anomalous diffusion problems.</TITLE>We consider various anomalous d -dimensional diffusion problems in the presence of an absorbing boundary with radial symmetry. The motion of particles is described by a fractional diffusion equation. Their mean-square displacement is given by r(2) proportional, variant t(gamma)(0<gamma< or =1) , resulting in normal diffusive motion if gamma=1 and subdiffusive motion otherwise. For the subdiffusive case in sufficiently high dimensions, divergent series appear when the concentration or survival probabilities are evaluated via the method of separation of variables. While the solution for normal diffusion problems is, at most, divergent as t-->0 , the emergence of such series in the long-time domain is a specific feature of subdiffusion problems. We present a method to regularize such series, and, in some cases, validate the procedure by using alternative techniques (Laplace transform method and numerical simulations). In the normal diffusion case, we find that the signature of the initial condition on the approach to the steady state rapidly fades away and the solution approaches a single (the main) decay mode in the long-time regime. In remarkable contrast, long-time memory of the initial condition is present in the subdiffusive case as the spatial part Psi1(r) describing the long-time decay of the solution to the steady state is determined by a weighted superposition of all spatial modes characteristic of the normal diffusion problem, the weight being dependent on the initial condition. Interestingly, Psi1(r) turns out to be independent of the anomalous diffusion exponent gamma .	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20462704	<TITLE>Recalibrating sleep: is recalibration and readjustment of sense organs and brain-body connections the core function of sleep?</TITLE>Sleep is an enigma because we all know what it means and does to us, yet a scientific explanation for why animals including humans need to sleep is still lacking. However, the enigma can be resolved if the animal body is regarded as a purposeful machine whose moving parts are coordinated with spatial information provided by a disparate array of sense organs. The performance of all complex machines deteriorates with time due to inevitable instrument drift of the individual sensors combined with wear and tear of the moving parts which result in declining precision and coordination. Peak performance is restored by servicing the machine, which involves calibrating the sensors against baselines and standards, then with one another, and finally readjusting the connections between instruments and moving parts. It follows that the animal body and its sensors will also require regular calibration of sense organs and readjustment of brain-body connections which will need to be carried out while the animal is not in functional but in calibration mode. I suggest that this is the core function of sleep. This recalibration hypothesis of sleep can be tested subjectively. We all know from personal experience that sleep is needed to recover from tiredness that sets in towards the end of a long day. This tiredness, which is quite distinct from mental or muscular exhaustion caused by strenuous exertion, manifests itself in deteriorating general performance: the sense organs lose precision, movements become clumsy and the mind struggles to maintain focus. We can all agree that sleep sharpens the sense organs and restores agility to mind and body. I now propose that the sense of freshness and buoyancy after a good night's sleep is the feeling of recalibrated sensory and motor systems. The hypothesis can be tested rigorously by examining available data on sleep cycles and stages against this background. For instance, REM and deep sleep cycles can be interpreted as successive, separate calibration runs of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and the sensory-motor systems, respectively, amongst other functions running in parallel, such as dreaming. Because the split-second connections between sensory information and emotional responses will also require calibration, some aspects of dreaming could be interpreted in this light. Much of the baffling behaviour and patterns of brain activity of sleeping animals and humans make sense in the framework of this technological paradigm since different animal lineages will have evolved different techniques to achieve calibration.

20515447	<TITLE>Characterization of H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from humans in vitro.</TITLE>Since December 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have swept through poultry populations across Asian countries and been transmitted into African and European countries. We characterized 6 avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in 2004 in Thailand. A highly pathogenic (HP) KAN353 strain showed faster replication and higher virulence in embryonated eggs compared to other strains, especially compared to the low pathogenic (LP) SP83 strain. HP KAN353 also showed strong cytopathogenicity compared to SP83 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Interestingly, LP SP83 induced smaller plaques compared to other strains, especially HP KAN353. PB2 amino acid 627E may contribute to low virulence, whereas either PB2 amino acid 627 K or the combination of 627E/701N seems to be associated with high virulence. The in vitro assays used in this study may provide the basis for assessing the pathogenesis of influenza H5N1 viruses in vivo.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20548241	<TITLE>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the thoracic vessels: an intraindividual comparison of different k-space acquisition strategies.</TITLE>The combination of parallel acquisition (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions) and time-resolved three-dimensional (3D) view-sharing techniques is a promising tool for dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D-magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). We evaluated the influence of different k-space acquisition strategies on image quality for a recently developed time-resolved echo-shared angiographic technique during a contrast-enhanced 3D-MRA of the thoracic vessels.|In 20 patients (16 men, 4 women; range, 28-75 years), 2 dynamic MRA protocols with different k-space acquisition strategies were performed on a 1.5-T whole-body scanner (MAGNETOM Avanto, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) during injection of 5 mL (flow-rate, 3 mL/s) gadobutrol. For protocol 1, the central-region which was updated with every cycle included 20% of the entire k-space (protocol 2: 10%), the peripheral-region was undersampled by a factor of 10 (protocol 2: 5%). Image quality and details were compared visually. Signal-to-noise ratio and sharpness of vessel borders were estimated.|Morphologic and functional assessment of the pulmonary arteries and the aorta was significantly improved for protocol 1. The sharpness of vessel borders (3.3 mm vs. 4.1 mm; P = 0.001), image quality, and the visibility of image details were significantly improved for protocol 1 compared with protocol 2.|The size of the central region that is updated for every frame seems to be more crucial for image quality of echo-shared angiographic techniques than the sampling density in the periphery of the k-space.

Specific consideration is given to the effect of photon path length on the signals obtained from laser Doppler detection of blood flow in tissue microvasculature. We show how changes in blood volume or variation in spacing between delivery and detecting fibers might affect the measurements. We also examine how changes in path length can affect parameters determined by time resolved optical spectroscopy of blood oxygenation. Anisotropies in the angular distribution of scattered photons are taken into account.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20572662	<TITLE>Time-dependent polymerization kinetic study and the properties of hybrid polymers with functional silsesquioxanes.</TITLE>Methacrylate-functionalized cubic silsesquioxane homopolymers [p(MA-CSSQ)] were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-mediated living radical polymerization in the presence of dodecyl(dimethylacetic acid)trithiocarbonate (DDTA) chain transfer agent, and their polymerization kinetics were studied. The DDTA-terminated p(MA-CSSQ) was then employed as a macro-RAFT agent in the polymerization of methylmethacrylate (MMA) for the synthesis of a brushlike p(MA-CSSQ)-b-PMMA block copolymer. The kinetics study of p(MA-CSSQ) showed that the monomer to polymer conversion, evaluated by (1)H NMR, was found to be approximately 80% with the maximum number average molecular weight (M(n)) of 24000 and 32300 Da, for the [MA-CSSQ]/[DDTA] ratios of 100 and 200, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The broadening of molecular weight distributions in p(MA-CSSQ) homopolymer GPC traces was observed, presumably due to the presence of the radical-radical termination products. The resultant homopolymer and block copolymer exhibited excellent thermal stability as evidenced by thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses. The surface properties of p(MA-CSSQ) homopolymer and p(MA-CSSQ)-b-PMMA block copolymer, determined by water contact angle and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, strongly indicated the surface enrichment of the hydrophobic silsesquioxane groups. The AFM images showed the microsized granular domains of p(MA-CSSQ) homopolymer, whereas the islandlike phase-separated domains were observed in p(MA-CSSQ)-b-PMMA block copolymer.

New quality indicators (QIs) for SLE advise bone mineral density testing, calcium and vitamin D use, and antiresorptive or anabolic treatment for specific subgroups of patients receiving high-dose steroids.|Subjects were participants in the University of California, San Francisco Lupus Outcomes Study, an ongoing longitudinal study of patients with physician-confirmed SLE, in 2007-2008. Patients responded to an annual telephone survey and were queried regarding demographic, clinical, and other health care-related variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict receipt of care per the QIs described above.|One hundred twenty-seven patients met the criteria for the formal definitions of the denominators for QI I (screening) and QI II (calcium and vitamin D); 91 met the formal criteria for QI III (treatment). The proportions of patients receiving care consistent with the QIs were 74%, 58%, and 56% for QIs I, II, and III, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis of all steroid users (n = 427 for QI I and II and n = 224 for QI III), rates were slightly lower. Predictors of receiving care varied by QI and by denominator; however, female sex, older age, white race, and longer disease duration were associated with higher-quality care.|Bone health-related care in this community-based cohort of SLE patients is suboptimal. Quality improvement efforts should address osteoporosis prevention and care among all SLE patients, especially those receiving high-dose, prolonged steroids.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
20607293	<TITLE>Competition for patchy soil resources reduces community evenness.</TITLE>The presence of small-scale patches of soil resources has been predicted to increase competition, because multiple species will proliferate roots in the same small area, and therefore decrease plant diversity. I tested whether such patches reduced species evenness in a community of four old-field species, both with and without interspecific interactions. In species mixtures, patches reduced evenness, while in "communities" constructed via combined monocultures, in which species did not compete, patches increased evenness. Therefore, the reduction in evenness in response to patches was due to changes in competition. Community-level changes may be attributable to plant foraging traits-in species with low foraging precision, competition reduced abundance much more in patchy soils than in even soils, while in species with high root foraging precision, the effect of competition was similar in patchy and even soils.

20610173	<TITLE>Pesticides' influence on wine fermentation.</TITLE>Wine quality strongly depends on the grape quality. To obtain high-quality wines, it is necessary to process healthy grapes at the correct ripeness stage and for this reason the farmer has to be especially careful in the prevention of parasite attacks on the grapevine. The most common fungal diseases affecting grape quality are downy and powdery mildew (Plasmopara viticola and Uncinula necator), and gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). On the other hand, the most dangerous insects are the grape moth (Lobesia botrana), vine mealybug (Planococcus ficus), and the citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri). Farmers fight grape diseases and insects applying pesticides that can be found at harvest time on grapes. The persistence of pesticides depends on the chemical characteristic of the active ingredients as well as on photodegradation, thermodegradation, codistillation, and enzymatic degradation. The pesticide residues on grapes can be transferred to the must and this can influence the selection and development of yeast strains. Moreover, yeasts can also influence the levels of the pesticides in the wine by reducing or adsorbing them on lees. During the fermentative process, yeasts can cause the disappearance of pesticide residues by degradation or absorption at the end of the fermentation when yeasts are deposited as lees. In this chapter, we reviewed the effect of commonly used herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides on yeasts. We also studied the effect of alcoholic and malolactic fermentation on pesticide residues.

20688883	<TITLE>Associations between serum leptin level and bone turnover in kidney transplant recipients.</TITLE>Obesity is associated with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A direct effect of adipose tissue on bone turnover through leptin production has been suggested, but such an association has not been explored in kidney transplant recipients.|This study examined associations of serum leptin with PTH and with biomarkers of bone turnover (serum beta crosslaps [CTX, a marker of bone resorption] and osteocalcin [OC, a marker of bone formation]) in 978 kidney transplant recipients. Associations were examined in multivariable regression models. Path analyses were used to determine if the association of leptin with bone turnover is independent of PTH.|Higher leptin levels were associated with higher PTH and lower vitamin D levels, and adjustment for vitamin D attenuated the association between leptin and PTH. However, higher leptin was also significantly associated with lower levels of the bone turnover markers: 1 SD higher leptin was associated with 0.13 lower log-OC (-0.17, -0.08, P < 0.001) and 0.030 lower log-CTX (-0.045, -0.016, P < 0.001) after multivariable adjustments. Path analysis indicated that the association of leptin with PTH was mostly mediated through vitamin D, and that the association between leptin and bone turnover was independent of PTH and vitamin D.|Elevated leptin level is associated with lower bone turnover independent of its effects on serum PTH in kidney transplant recipients.

Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 3 months were enrolled in the study. Osteoporosis was induced by bilateral ovariectomy and subsequent daily heparin injection started 1 week after surgery and lasted for 4 weeks. Osteoporosis was confirmed by a reduction of bone mineral density (BMD). Twenty of the osteoporotic rats were assigned to the SrR group and the remaining 20 to the control group. An open right tibial midshaft transverse fracture was created and then an intramedullary fixation was performed. SrR group was treated by 450 mg/kg/day SrR per oral. Six weeks after surgical induction of fracture, all animals were sacrificed. One animal from each group died after ovariectomy. Two tibiae from the control group failed to unite. SrR-treated group showed higher mechanical strength and fracture stiffness when compared to the control group (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively). SrR-treated group had mature woven bone or predominantly woven bone compared with osteoporotic control group (p = 0.038). SrR-treated group's callus maturity was significantly higher than control group (p = 0.001). SrR is associated with better fracture healing in the osteoporotic rat model.

After caries removal, a layer of calcium hydroxide and glass ionomer base, Fuji II LC were applied. The teeth were restored using an adhesive system, Excite, and flowable composite, Tetric-Flow. The cavities were then restored incrementally with a Tetric Ceram HB. All the 25 restorations were evaluated after 3.5 years by two independent evaluators. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar test.|Surface texture for all restorations was classified as excellent. There were no evidence of secondary caries and bulk fracture in any of the restorations. Regarding the items of anatomical form and marginal integrity the statistical analysis reveled a significant difference between the baseline and recall scores respectively (P=0.031 and P=0.031).|It was concluded that Tertic Ceram HB exhibited excellent clinical performance after 3.5 years in the open apex first permanent molar teeth.

Central composite design (CCD) was used for optimization of several factors affecting the extraction efficiency. The optimized conditions were established to be 550 rpm for stirring rate, 35 min for extraction time, 57 °C for extraction temperature, 8.5 for solution pH, 10 μl for organic solvent volume, and 7% (w/v) of NaCl for ionic strength. Limit of detections (LODs) of the extraction method ranged from 0.01 to 0.1 μg L(-1) and the linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) ranged from 0.1 to 300 μg L(-1) for the three antifungal drugs. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the proposed method were 5-11%. Preconcentration factors in the range of 306-1350 were obtained at extraction time of 35 min. Finally, performance of the proposed method was evaluated for the extraction and determination of the drugs' levels in microgram per liter in samples and satisfactory results were obtained.

We have studied 23 adult small bowel transplant patients aged 19.8-59 years (mean = 38.2 years), who were presented with diarrhea and tested positive for rotavirus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Serial follow-up biopsies, as well as clinical data, are documented and analyzed. These patients were followed up for an average of 168 days (range 33-534 days). Mean time of rotavirus diagnosis from transplant day was 794 days (range 38-2907 days). Self-limited diarrhea lasting 6-13 days (mean = 9 days) was the main presentation. Sixteen (69.6%) patients developed acute cellular rejection either concurrently with (i.e. six patients) or after (10 patients) RVE, often characterized by prominent mucosal plasmacytosis at an average of 22 days (range 0-94 days) from the day RVE was diagnosed. One-third of patients with acute rejection (i.e. five out of 16) required muromonab-CD3 rescue therapy. Two patients experienced graft loss (one from chronic rejection, another from sepsis). Rotavirus infection is a cause of diarrhea in adult small bowel transplant patients. The infection appeared to trigger cellular rejection that was associated with mucosal plasmacytosis, and sometimes required aggressive rescue therapy.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Eleven years after primary vaccination, the proportion of vaccinees with titres ≥ 10 mIU/ml and antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were lower among celiac patients than among controls (68.6% vs 91.7%, p<0.01; GMCs 29.38 mIU/ml vs 250.6 mIU/ml, p<0.001). Participants with anti-HBs below 10 mIU/ml received a booster dose and were retested 2 weeks later to assess the anamnestic response. Post-booster anti-HBs levels were still <10 mIU/ml in 71.4% celiacs and 25% controls (p<0.01). Our findings indicate that the prevalence of seroprotective levels of anti-HBs detected eleven years after primary immunization as well as the frequency of response to a booster dose of vaccine are lower in celiac patients compared to healthy controls.

21139433	<TITLE>Die for living better: plants modify root system architecture through inducing PCD in root meristem under severe water stress.</TITLE>Plant root development is highly plastic in order to cope with various environmental stresses; many questions on the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity of root system remain unanswered. Recently, we showed that autophagic PCD occurs in the region of root apical meristem in response to severe water deficit. We provided evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation may trigger the cell death process of the meristematic cells in the stressed root tips. Analysis of BAX inhibitor-1 (AtBI1) expression and the phenotypic response of atbi1-1 mutant under the severe water stress revealed that AtBI1 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway modulate water stress-induced PCD. As a result, the thick and short lateral roots with increased tolerance to the stress are induced. We propose that under severe drought condition, plants activate PCD program in the root apical root meristem, so that apical root dominance is removed.

The cytoskeletal anchorage of glycoprotein (GP) Ibα plays an important role in regulating the membrane skeleton. However, its role in regulating membrane stability remains unknown. To investigate this role, we have developed a new mouse model that expresses wild-type human GPIbα (hGPIbα(WT)), or a mutant form of human GPIbα that has a selective defect in its ability to bind filamin A and anchor to the membrane skeleton (hGPIbα(FW)-Phe568Ala and Trp570Ala substitutions). Our study demonstrates that the link between platelet GPIb and the cytoskeleton does not alter the intrinsic ligand binding function of GPIbα or the ability of the receptor to stimulate integrin α(IIb)β(3)-dependent spreading. However, exposure of hGPIbα(FW) platelets to pathologic shear rate levels (5000 to 40,000 s(-1)) leads to the development of unstable membrane tethers, defective platelet adhesion, and loss of membrane integrity, leading to complete disintegration of the platelet cell body. These outcomes suggest that the GPIbα-filamin A interaction not only regulates the architecture of the membrane skeleton, but also maintains the mechanical stability of the plasma membrane under conditions of high shear.

21159481	<TITLE>Self-classification as an adult in patients with type 1 diabetes: relationships with glycemic control and illness coping.</TITLE>Previous community research has demonstrated the link between adult self-classification and health behaviors. The present study investigated the extent to which individuals with type 1 diabetes (ages 18-30 years) classified themselves as adults as compared with individuals without diabetes. Adult self-classification was examined in relation to illness coping and glycemic control.|A total of 194 patients and 287 control individuals participated. Adult self-classification was assessed using a single item, coping was assessed using the Diabetes Coping Measure, and glycemic control was determined by HbA(1c) values.|Compared with control participants, more patients classified themselves as adults. Furthermore, adult self-classification was positively related to glycemic control. Structural equation modeling indicated that coping mediated the relationship between adult self-classification and glycemic control.|Individuals with diabetes classified themselves as adults more often than did their peers without diabetes, possibly due to their need to master their lives when confronted with diabetes. Adult self-classification appeared to function as a resource for glycemic control through its relationship with specific coping strategies.|The present study underscores the need to assess adult self-classification in individuals with diabetes. Our findings call for a developmentally tailored transition from pediatric to adult care.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21193663	<TITLE>Role of the cell wall microenvironment in expression of a heterologous SpaP-S1 fusion protein by Streptococcus gordonii.</TITLE>The charge density in the cell wall microenvironment of Gram-positive bacteria is believed to influence the expression of heterologous proteins. To test this, the expression of a SpaP-S1 fusion protein, consisting of the surface protein SpaP of Streptococcus mutans and a pertussis toxin S1 fragment, was studied in the live vaccine candidate bacterium Streptococcus gordonii. Results showed that the parent strain PM14 expressed very low levels of SpaP-S1. By comparison, the dlt mutant strain, which has a mutation in the dlt operon preventing d-alanylation of the cell wall lipoteichoic acids, and another mutant strain, OB219(pPM14), which lacks the LPXTG major surface proteins SspA and SspB, expressed more SpaP-S1 than the parent. Both the dlt mutant and the OB219(pPM14) strain had a more negatively charged cell surface than PM14, suggesting that the negative charged cell wall played a role in the increase in SpaP-S1 production. Accordingly, the addition of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and K(+), presumably increasing the positive charge of the cell wall, led to a reduction in SpaP-S1 production, while the addition of bicarbonate resulted in an increase in SpaP-S1 production. The level of SpaP-S1 production could be correlated with the level of PrsA, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, in the cells. PrsA expression appears to be regulated by the cell envelope stress two-component regulatory system LiaSR. The results collectively indicate that the charge density of the cell wall microenvironment can modulate heterologous SpaP-S1 protein expression in S. gordonii and that this modulation is mediated by the level of PrsA, whose expression is regulated by the LiaSR two-component regulatory system.

A total of 350 RNA samples from 78 human autopsy cases, 21 variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 26 other neurological diseases and 31 non-neurological diseases were studied.|There was no difference in the quality or yield of RNA isolated from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, other neurological disease and non-neurological disease brains. RNA preparations from archived frozen half brains or snap frozen autopsy samples were generally of poor quality (RNA integrity number<5). There was a highly significant negative correlation between the number of times frozen half brains had been sampled and the quality of RNA. Samples stored in RNALater provided higher-quality RNA (RNA integrity number>5). Age at death, gender, post mortem interval and freezer storage time had no effect on RNA quality.|Reasonable-quality RNA can be isolated from samples dissected from archived frozen human half brains but repeated sampling results in RNA degradation. Better-quality RNA is obtained from samples placed in RNALater than from snap frozen samples. The quality and yield of RNA are not affected by age at death, gender, post mortem interval of >6 h or freezer storage time.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21251292	<TITLE>Examination of relaxin and its receptors expression in pig gametes and embryos.</TITLE>Relaxin is a small peptide also known as pregnancy hormone in many mammals. It is synthesized by both male and female tissues, and its secretions are found in various body fluids such as plasma serum, ovarian follicular fluid, utero-oviduct secretions, and seminal plasma of many mammals, including pigs. However, the presence and effects of relaxin in porcine gametes and embryos are still not well-known. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of relaxin and its receptors RXFP1 and RXFP2 in pig gametes and embryos.|Immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from sows' ovaries collected at the abattoir. After in vitro-maturation, COCs were in vitro-fertilized and cultured. For studies, immature and mature COCs were separately collected, and oocytes were freed from their surrounding cumulus cells. Denuded oocytes, cumulus cells, mature boar spermatozoa, zygotes, and embryos (cleaved and blastocysts) were harvested for temporal and spatial gene expression studies. Sections of ovary, granulosa and neonatal porcine uterine cells were also collected to use as controls.|Using both semi-quantitative and quantitative PCRs, relaxin transcripts were not detected in all tested samples, while RXFP1 and RXFP2 mRNA were present. Both receptor gene products were found at higher levels in oocytes compared to cumulus cells, irrespective of the maturation time. Cleaved-embryos contained higher levels of RXFP2 mRNA, whereas, blastocysts were characterized by a higher RXFP1 mRNA content. Using western-immunoblotting or in situ immunofluorescence, relaxin and its receptor proteins were detected in all samples. Their fluorescence intensities were consistently more important in mature oocytes than immature ones. The RXFP1 and RXFP2 signal intensities were mostly located in the plasma membrane region, while the relaxin ones appeared homogeneously distributed within the oocytes and embryonic cells. Furthermore, spermatozoa displayed stronger RXFP2 signal than RXFP1 after western-immunoblotting.|All together, our findings suggest potential roles of relaxin and its receptors during oocyte maturation, early embryo development, and beyond.

In this paper, we investigate the potential use of terahertz (THz) pulsed imaging to quantitatively measure the early symptoms of OA in an animal model. THz images of excised rabbit femoral condyles were taken. We observe THz waves reflected off different layers within samples and demonstrate that the optical delay between reflections can give a quantitative measure of the thicknesses of particular tissues within cartilage.

21304140	<TITLE>SPECT imaging of dopamine transporters with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 in major depression and Parkinson's disease.</TITLE>To investigate dopamine transporter in major depressive disorder and Parkinson's disease, the authors obtained single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain images from 13 patients with major depression, 17 Parkinson's disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers by using 99mTc-TRODAT-1. The authors found the 99mTc-TRODAT-1 radio signal in the striatum was reduced in the majority of patients with major depressive disorder, and this decrease was even more severe in patients with Parkinson's disease. The results support the hypothesis of dopamine hypofunction in major depressive disorder and suggest that deficient dopamine transporter may be involved in the etiology of severe major depressive disorder.

21324662	<TITLE>Methane oxidation in landfill waste biocover soil: kinetics and sensitivity to ambient conditions.</TITLE>Waste biocover soil was investigated as an alternative in regions with a shortage of landfill cover soil. In the work, effects of the composition, ambient conditions and nitrogen stress on CH(4) oxidation in waste biocover soil were studied. The results showed that the optimal composition of waste biocover soil as a landfill cover material for CH(4) oxidation was original pH value, 45% moisture and a particle size of ≤ 4mm. CH(4) oxidation rate increased rapidly over a CH(4) concentration range of 0.01-10% (v/v), and kept stable at CH(4) concentrations of 10-30% (v/v). The Michaelis-Menten model showed a good fit for the kinetic of CH(4) oxidation in landfill waste biocover soil with a maximum of 9.03 μmol/gd.w./h. The average Q(10) was 10.6 in the batch experiments. A level of 5% of oxygen concentration was enough to sustain the activity of methanotrophs community structure in waste biocover soil. Waste biocover soil had low baseline concentrations of NH(4)(+)-N and NO(3)(-)-N. Ammonia volatilization from landfills and nitrification in landfill waste biocover soils might stimulate CH(4) consumption at concentrations below 600 mg/kg. However, the contents of NH(4)(+)-N and NO(3)(-)-N above 1200 mg/kg would inhibit CH(4) oxidation in landfill waste biocover soil. Compared with NO(3)(-)-N, NH(4)(+)-N had a greater stimulating action as nutrient at lower concentrations and inhibitory effect at higher concentrations on CH(4) oxidation in landfill waste biocover soil.

21332765	<TITLE>Characterization of olfactory sensilla of Stomoxys calcitrans and electrophysiological responses to odorant compounds associated with hosts and oviposition media.</TITLE>Stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans L. (Diptera: Muscidae), are economically important biting flies that have caused billions of dollars in losses in the livestock industry. Field monitoring studies have indicated that olfaction plays an important role in host location. To further our understanding of stable fly olfaction, we examined the antennal morphology of adults using scanning electron microscopy techniques. Four major types of sensillum were found and classified as: (a) basiconic sensilla; (b) trichoid sensilla with three subtypes; (c) clavate sensilla, and (d) coeloconic sensilla. No significant differences between male and female flies in abundances (total numbers) of these sensillum types were observed, except for medium-sized trichoid sensilla. The distinctive pore structures found on the surface of basiconic and clavate sensilla suggest their olfactory functions. No wall pores were found in trichoid and coeloconic sensilla, which suggests that these two types of sensillum may function as mechano-receptors. Details of the distributions of different sensillum types located on the funicle of the fly antenna were also recorded. Electroantennogram results indicated significant antennal responses to host-associated compounds. The importance of stable fly olfaction relative to host and host environment seeking is discussed. This research provides valuable new information that will enhance future developments in integrated stable fly management.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21373943	<TITLE>A case presenting with rapid renal damage caused by immunoglobulin D lambda-type multiple myeloma accompanied by granular lymphocyte proliferative disorder.</TITLE>A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital for severe anemia. The atypical lymphocyte count, including granular lymphocytes, was 2,750/μL. Lymphocyte surface marker analysis showed CD3+, CD5+, CD16+, and CD56+ cells. Mixed T cell- and natural killer cell-type granular lymphocyte proliferative disorder (GLPD) was diagnosed. Because his serum creatinine levels deteriorated rapidly over the next 3 months, from 0.96 to 3.27 mg/dL, he was admitted to our hospital. The serum levels of immunoglobulins (Ig) other than IgD had decreased, and monoclonal protein was detected in the gamma-globulin region. Immunoelectrophoresis revealed IgD and lambda (λ) proteins in the serum and λ-type Bence-Jones protein in the urine. Renal biopsy examination revealed widespread tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, and cast formation with λ protein deposits in tubular lumens, indicating cast nephropathy. These results indicated that the rapid renal damage was caused by IgD λ-type multiple myeloma accompanied by GLPD. The clinical course of GLPD is not usually aggressive and the findings of physical examinations are not significant. GLPD is usually associated with cytopenia (neutropenia or anemia), viral infections, collagen diseases, neoplasms such as malignant lymphoma, or chronic infections. To date, there are only 2 case reports of GLPD accompanied by multiple myeloma but without renal function or renal histological findings. When the clinical course of GLPD is aggressive and is accompanied with rapid renal damage, multiple myeloma should be considered as a complication.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21402068	<TITLE>Apc bridges Wnt/β-catenin and BMP signaling during osteoblast differentiation of KS483 cells.</TITLE>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway influences the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages in a quantitative and qualitative fashion depending on the dose of β-catenin signaling. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is the critical intracellular regulator of β-catenin turnover. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Apc in regulating the differentiation capacity of skeletal progenitor cells, we have knocked down Apc in the murine mesenchymal stem cell-like KS483 cells by stable expression of Apc-specific small interfering RNA. In routine culture, KSFrt-Apc(si) cells displayed a mesenchymal-like spindle shape morphology, exhibited markedly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Apc knockdown resulted in upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin and the BMP/Smad signaling pathways, but osteogenic differentiation was completely inhibited. This effect could be rescued by adding high concentrations of BMP-7 to the differentiation medium. Furthermore, KSFrt-Apc(si) cells showed no potential to differentiate into chondrocytes or adipocytes. These results demonstrate that Apc is essential for the proliferation, survival and differentiation of KS483 cells. Apc knockdown blocks the osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells, a process that can be overruled by high BMP signaling.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21421061	<TITLE>Differential effects of DAAO on regional activation and functional connectivity in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and controls.</TITLE>Recent studies have identified DAAO as a probable susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, little is known about how this gene affects brain function to increase vulnerability to these disorders. We examined the impact of DAAO genotype (rs3918346) on brain function in patients with schizophrenia, patients with bipolar I disorder and healthy controls. We tested the hypothesis that a variation in DAAO genotype would be associated with altered prefrontal function and altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain responses during a verbal fluency task in a total of 121 subjects comprising 40 patients with schizophrenia, 33 patients with bipolar disorder and 48 healthy volunteers. We then used statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analyses to estimate the main effects of diagnostic group, the main effect of genotype, and their interaction on brain activation and on functional connectivity. Inferences were made at p<0.05, after correction for multiple comparisons across the whole brain. In the schizophrenia group relative to the control group, patients with one or two copies of the T allele showed lower deactivation in the left precuneus and greater activation in the right posterior cingulate gyrus than patients with two copies of the C allele. This diagnosis×genotype interaction was associated with differences in the functional connectivity of these two regions with other cortical and subcortical areas. In contrast, there were no significant effects of diagnosis or of genotype in comparisons involving bipolar patients. Our results suggest that genetic variation in DAAO has a significant impact on both regional activation and functional connectivity, and provide evidence for a diagnosis-dependent pattern of gene action.

21426574	<TITLE>How can we improve guideline use? A conceptual framework of implementability.</TITLE>Guidelines continue to be underutilized, and a variety of strategies to improve their use have been suboptimal. Modifying guideline features represents an alternative, but untested way to promote their use. The purpose of this study was to identify and define features that facilitate guideline use, and examine whether and how they are included in current guidelines.|A guideline implementability framework was developed by reviewing the implementation science literature. We then examined whether guidelines included these, or additional implementability elements. Data were extracted from publicly available high quality guidelines reflecting primary and institutional care, reviewed independently by two individuals, who through discussion resolved conflicts, then by the research team.|The final implementability framework included 22 elements organized in the domains of adaptability, usability, validity, applicability, communicability, accommodation, implementation, and evaluation. Data were extracted from 20 guidelines on the management of diabetes, hypertension, leg ulcer, and heart failure. Most contained a large volume of graded, narrative evidence, and tables featuring complementary clinical information. Few contained additional features that could improve guideline use. These included alternate versions for different users and purposes, summaries of evidence and recommendations, information to facilitate interaction with and involvement of patients, details of resource implications, and instructions on how to locally promote and monitor guideline use. There were no consistent trends by guideline topic.|Numerous opportunities were identified by which guidelines could be modified to support various types of decision making by different users. New governance structures may be required to accommodate development of guidelines with these features. Further research is needed to validate the proposed framework of guideline implementability, develop methods for preparing this information, and evaluate how inclusion of this information influences guideline use.

21432195	<TITLE>Community-based analysis of the factorial structures of the recent increase in low birthweight infants.</TITLE>This study was conducted to determine whether the regional factors were related to the increase in the percentage of low birthweight (LBW: <2,500g) infants in Kumamoto Pref., and to establish a tentative structure model for predicting low birthweight infants. Analyses for frequency of LBW infants between 1974 and 1997, and a multiple regression model and covariance structure model were conducted using data from the vital statistics between 1992 and 1997 and regional indicators concerned with LBW infants from official registered statistical data between 1992 and 1997. The 72 regional factors were clustered into four groups linked with agricultural areas such as Urban, Flat, Hilly and Mountainous areas. The recent increase in the incidence of LBW infants resulted from the increase in moderate-LBW (MLBW: 2,000-2,500 g) infants of full term-LBW infants. There was a steady annual increase in the Urban agricultural area LBW infants since 1992. The two structure analyses revealed that the Urban area had a marked effect on the increase in LBW infants, whereas, farm villages in Hilly or Moutainous areas had less effect on the increase in LBW infants. These findings suggest that the regional factors relating to the mothers' life-style or regional environments play a key role in the etiology and prevention of LBW, and will be a useful in the analyses using official registered material.

21439797	<TITLE>Factors affecting drug encapsulation and stability of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles.</TITLE>Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles are polymeric nanoparticles enveloped by lipid layers that combine the highly biocompatible nature of lipids with the structural integrity afforded by polymeric nanoparticles. Recognizing them as attractive drug delivery vehicles, antibiotics are encapsulated in the present work into hybrid nanoparticles intended for lung biofilm infection therapy. Modified emulsification-solvent-evaporation methods using lipid as surfactant are employed to prepare the hybrid nanoparticles. Biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and phosphatidylcholine are used as the polymer and lipid models, respectively. Three fluoroquinolone antibiotics (i.e. levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin), which vary in their ionicity, lipophilicity, and aqueous solubility, are used. The hybrid nanoparticles are examined in terms of their drug encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, stability, and in vitro drug release profile. Compared to polymeric nanoparticles prepared using non-lipid surfactants, hybrid nanoparticles in general are larger and exhibit higher drug loading, except for the ciprofloxacin-encapsulated nanoparticles. Hybrid nanoparticles, however, are unstable in salt solutions, but the stability can be conferred by adding TPGS into the formulation. Drug-lipid ionic interactions and drug lipophilicity play important roles in the hybrid nanoparticle preparation. First, interactions between oppositely charged lipid and antibiotic (i.e. ciprofloxacin) during preparation cause failed nanoparticle formation. Charge reversal of the lipid facilitated by adding counterionic surfactants (e.g. stearylamine) must be performed before drug encapsulation can take place. Second, drug loading and the release profile are strongly influenced by drug lipophilicity, where more lipophilic drug (i.e. levofloxacin) exhibit a higher drug loading and a sustained release profile attributed to the interaction with the lipid coat.

21467038	<TITLE>Ric-8B is a GTP-dependent G protein alphas guanine nucleotide exchange factor.</TITLE>ric-8 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8) genes have positive roles in variegated G protein signaling pathways, including Gα(q) and Gα(s) regulation of neurotransmission, Gα(i)-dependent mitotic spindle positioning during (asymmetric) cell division, and Gα(olf)-dependent odorant receptor signaling. Mammalian Ric-8 activities are partitioned between two genes, ric-8A and ric-8B. Ric-8A is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Gα(i)/α(q)/α(12/13) subunits. Ric-8B potentiated G(s) signaling presumably as a Gα(s)-class GEF activator, but no demonstration has shown Ric-8B GEF activity. Here, two Ric-8B isoforms were purified and found to be Gα subunit GDP release factor/GEFs. In HeLa cells, full-length Ric-8B (Ric-8BFL) bound endogenously expressed Gα(s) and lesser amounts of Gα(q) and Gα(13). Ric-8BFL stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding to these subunits and Gα(olf), whereas the Ric-8BΔ9 isoform stimulated Gα(s short) GTPγS binding only. Michaelis-Menten experiments showed that Ric-8BFL elevated the V(max) of Gα(s) steady state GTP hydrolysis and the apparent K(m) values of GTP binding to Gα(s) from ∼385 nm to an estimated value of ∼42 μM. Directionality of the Ric-8BFL-catalyzed Gα(s) exchange reaction was GTP-dependent. At sub-K(m) GTP, Ric-BFL was inhibitory to exchange despite being a rapid GDP release accelerator. Ric-8BFL binds nucleotide-free Gα(s) tightly, and near-K(m) GTP levels were required to dissociate the Ric-8B·Gα nucleotide-free intermediate to release free Ric-8B and Gα-GTP. Ric-8BFL-catalyzed nucleotide exchange probably proceeds in the forward direction to produce Gα-GTP in cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Multiple FGBH CTs were acquired at simulation, and single FGBH CBCTs were also acquired prior to each treatment. Simulation CTs and treatment CBCTs were analyzed to quantify reproducibility of tumor positions during FGBH. Benefits of FGBH gating compared to treatment during free breathing, as well treatment with gating at exhalation, were examined for lung sparing, motion margins, and reproducibility of gross tumor volume (GTV) position relative to nonmoving anatomy.|FGBH increased total lung volumes by 1.5 times compared to free breathing, resulting in a proportional drop in total lung volume receiving 10 Gy or more. Intra- and inter-FGBH reproducibility of GTV centroid positions at simulation were 1.0 ± 0.5 mm, 1.3 ± 1.0 mm, and 0.6 ± 0.4 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right lateral (LR) directions, respectively, compared to more than 1 cm of tumor motion at free breathing. During treatment, inter-FGBH reproducibility of the GTV centroid with respect to bony anatomy was 1.2 ± 0.7 mm, 1.5 ± 0.8 mm, and 1.0 ± 0.4 mm in the AP, SI, and LR directions. In addition, the quality of CBCTs was improved due to elimination of motion artifacts, making this technique attractive for poorly visualized tumors, even with small motion.|The extent of tumor motion at normal respiration does not influence the reproducibility of the tumor position under breath hold conditions. FGBH-gated SBRT with CBCT can improve the reproducibility of GTV centroids, reduce required margins, and minimize dose to normal tissues in the treatment of mobile tumors.

Comparison between the SMAT and a conventional magnetic attachment (CMAT) was performed for the retentive force under different dislodgement directions. Lateral forces to the abutment were also compared among the SMAT, CMAT, dome-shaped magnetic attachment, and a ball attachment. The SMAT maintained retentive force more effectively than the CMAT, even in oblique directions of dislodgement. A smaller lateral force to the abutment was found for the SMAT compared to the CMAT or ball attachment.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

In Colombia, data from 1980s described that HBV and HDV infection are important causes of hepatitis, but little is known about HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the currently frequency of HBV, HCV and HDV in four different Colombian regions.|This study was conducted in 697 habitants from 4 Colombian departments: Amazonas, Chocó, Magdalena and San Andres Islands. Epidemiological data were obtained from an interview applied to each individual aiming to evaluate risk factors related to HBV, HCV or HDV infections. All samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti-HCV markers. Samples that were positive to HBsAg and/or anti-HBc were tested to anti-HDV. Concerning the geographical origin of the samples, the three HBV markers showed a statistically significant difference: HBsAg (p = 0.033) and anti-HBc (p<0.001) were more frequent in Amazonas and Magdalena departments. Isolated anti-HBs (a marker of previous vaccination) frequencies were: Chocó (53.26%), Amazonas (32.88%), Magdalena (17.0%) and San Andrés (15.33%)--p<0.001. Prevalence of anti-HBc increased with age; HBsAg varied from 1.97 to 8.39% (p = 0.033). Amazonas department showed the highest frequency for anti-HCV marker (5.68%), while the lowest frequency was found in San Andrés Island (0.66%). Anti-HDV was found in 9 (5.20%) out of 173 anti-HBc and/or HBsAg positive samples, 8 of them from the Amazonas region and 1 from them Magdalena department.|In conclusion, HBV, HCV and HDV infections are detected throughout Colombia in frequency levels that would place some areas as hyperendemic for HBV, especially those found in Amazonas and Magdalena departments. Novel strategies to increase HBV immunization in the rural population and to strengthen HCV surveillance are reinforced by these results.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Samples were excised 1 hour after bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 250 mg/) e.v. infusion and fixed in 70% ethanol. Nuclear DNA content and BrdU incorporation, were simultaneously determined to obtain ploidy (DNA index) and proliferative activity (BrdU-labeling index, LI). No acute toxicity or side effects related to BrdU injection were recorded. The overall feasibility of the determinations was higher than 90% (93/102). Twenty-two out of 59 (37.2%) endometrial neoplasms and 23 out of 34 (67.6%) cervical neoplasms were aneuploid, with a median DNA-index of the aneuploid peak of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. Overall median BrdU LIs were 4.8% and 7.2%. Proliferative activity was found to be higher in aneuploid tumors (p<.05). DNA ploidy and/or BrdU-LI were not significantly related either with the clinical stage or the histopathologic grading in either tumor type. The BrdU in vivo administration coupled with bivariate FCM for measurement is a simple method that can be performed in clinical settings to better evaluate the prognostic significance of proliferative parameters in gynecological tumors.

21618410	<TITLE>Folate pathway polymorphisms predict deficits in attention and processing speed after childhood leukemia therapy.</TITLE>Neurocognitive impairment occurs in 20-40% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors, possibly mediated by folate depletion and homocysteine elevation following methotrexate treatment. We evaluated the relationship between folate pathway polymorphisms and neurocognitive impairment after childhood ALL chemotherapy.|Seventy-two childhood ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy alone underwent a neurocognitive battery consisting of: Trail Making Tests A (TMTA) and B (TMTB), Grooved Pegboard Test Dominant-Hand and Nondominant-Hand, Digit Span subtest, and Verbal Fluency Test. We performed genotyping for: 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C>T and MTHFR 1298A>C), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT 1420C>T), methionine synthase (MS 2756 A>G), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66A>G), and thymidylate synthase (TSER). Student's two sample t-test and analysis of covariance were used to compare test scores by genotype.|General impairment on the neurocognitive battery was related to MTHFR 1298A>C (P = 0.03) and MS 2756A>G (P = 0.05). Specifically, survivors with MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes scored, on average, 13 points lower on TMTB than those with MTHFR 1298AA genotype (P = 0.001). The MS 2756AA genotype was associated with a 12.2 point lower mean TMTA score, compared to MS 2756 AG/GG genotypes (P = 0.01). The TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes were associated with an 11.4 point lower mean score on TMTB, compared to the TSER 2R/2R genotype (P = 0.03). Survivors with ≥6 folate pathway risk alleles demonstrated a 9.5 point lower mean TMTA score (P = 0.06) and 14.5 point lower TMTB score (P = 0.002) than survivors with <6 risk alleles.|Folate pathway polymorphisms are associated with deficits in attention and processing speed after childhood ALL therapy.

21643113	<TITLE>Phase closure retrieval in an infrared-to-visible upconversion interferometer for high resolution astronomical imaging.</TITLE>This paper demonstrates the use of a nonlinear upconversion process to observe an infrared source through a telescope array detecting the interferometric signal in the visible domain. We experimentally demonstrate the possibility to retrieve information on the phase of the object spectrum of an infrared source by using a three-arm upconversion interferometer. We focus our study on the acquisition of phase information of the complex visibility by means of the phase closure technique. In our experimental demonstration, a laboratory binary star with an adjustable photometric ratio is used as a test source. A real time comparison between a standard three-arm interferometer and our new concept using upconversion by sum-frequency generation demonstrates the preservation of phase information which is essential for image reconstruction.

21732869	<TITLE>Concordance and discordance of couples living in a rural Pakistani village: perspectives on contraception and abortion--a qualitative study.</TITLE>In Pakistan, fertility rates and intended family size have fallen, but contraceptive use remains low. This has led to a high prevalence of unintended pregnancies, a large proportion of which result from disagreement between spouses about how to confront them. This study aims to understand how Pakistani couples view family planning, and how they communicate and make decisions surrounding fertility regulation. In-depth interviews were conducted with five couples and an additional five women and two men. Two focus groups--one for males and one for females--were also conducted. Family planning methods were more favoured by women than their husbands. Women reported the largest barrier to contraceptive use to be men's opposition to family planning or reproductive choices more generally, as well as fear of side effects of contraception. Abortion was viewed unfavourably except in situations of economic difficulty, having several young children or women's health problems. Couples reported rarely communicating about fertility intentions until later in childbearing after an unintended pregnancy. Discussions about family planning were largely initiated by women, although some felt unable to approach their husbands regarding this topic. Concordant intentions and communication between spouses led to desired pregnancy outcomes. In cases of discordance, women's intentions tended to determine actions and outcomes. Spousal communication, or the lack thereof, is an obstacle to effective contraceptive use, and strategies to improve couples' communication would undoubtedly enable them to achieve their reproductive intentions.

21770964	<TITLE>Comparison of the pressure redistribution qualities of two air-filled wheelchair cushions for people with spinal cord injuries.</TITLE>People with spinal cord injuries are at high risk of developing pressure ulcers. Wheelchair cushions that redistribute pressure are one prevention strategy to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers in this population. Currently, therapists have only limited evidence concerning the pressure redistribution qualities of wheelchair cushions to guide their cushion selection in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare the pressure redistribution qualities of two air-filled cushions currently recommended for people with spinal cord injuries.|A series of single case studies, based on the methodology used in a previous study, was undertaken on three inpatients with complete spinal cord injury. Interface pressure readings were compared between a Roho® and Vicair® cushion using the Xsensor® Pressure Mapping System. The Roho® cushion is comprised of a series of soft, flexible, inter-connected air cells, and the Vicair® cushion contains separate, sealed cells of air.|The Roho® cushion recorded significantly fewer cells with pressures ≥100 mmHg than the Vicair® cushion for the three participants.|This study has provided evidence that the Roho® cushion has superior pressure redistribution qualities than the Vicair® cushion for a small sample of patients with complete spinal cord injury.

21865666	<TITLE>G-protein-associated signal transduction processes are restored after postweaning environmental enrichment in Ts65Dn, a Down syndrome mouse model.</TITLE>Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) present cognitive deficits that can be improved by early implementation of special care programs. However, they showed limited and temporary cognitive effects. We previously demonstrated that postnatal environmental enrichment (EE) improved clearly, though temporarily, the execution of visuospatial memory tasks in Ts65Dn mice, a DS model bearing a partial trisomy of murine chromosome 16; but in contrast to wild-type littermates, there was a lack of structural plasticity in pyramidal cell structure in the trisomic cerebral cortex. In the present study, we have investigated the impact of EE on the function of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C as a possible mechanism underlying the time-limited improvements observed. Basal production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was not affected, but responses to GTPγS, isoprenaline, noradrenaline, SKF 38393 and forskolin were depressed in the Ts65Dn hippocampus. In EE conditions, cAMP accumulation was not significantly modified in control animals with respect to nonenriched controls. However, EE had a marked effect in Ts65Dn mice, in which cAMP production was significantly increased. Similarly, EE increased phospholipase C activity in Ts65Dn mice, in response to carbachol and calcium. We conclude that EE restores the G-protein-associated signal transduction systems that are altered in Ts65Dn mice.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21878673	<TITLE>The cooperating mutation or "second hit" determines the immunologic visibility toward MYC-induced murine lymphomas.</TITLE>In Eμ-myc transgenic animals lymphoma formation requires additional genetic alterations, which frequently comprise loss of p53 or overexpression of BCL-2. We describe that the nature of the "second hit" affects the ability of the immune system to contain lymphoma development. Tumors with disrupted p53 signaling killed the host more rapidly than BCL-2 overexpressing ones. Relaxing immunologic control, using Tyk2(-/-) mice or by Ab-mediated depletion of CD8(+) T or natural killer (NK) cells accelerated formation of BCL-2-overexpressing lymphomas but not of those lacking p53. Most strikingly, enforced expression of BCL-2 prolonged disease latency in the absence of p53, whereas blocking p53 function in BCL-2-overexpressing tumors failed to accelerate disease. This shows that blocking apoptosis in p53-deficient cells by enforcing BCL-2 expression can mitigate disease progression increasing the "immunologic visibility." In vitro cytotoxicity assays confirmed that high expression of BCL-2 protein facilitates NK and T cell-mediated killing. Moreover, we found that high BCL-2 expression is accompanied by significantly increased levels of the NKG2D ligand MULT1, which may account for the enhanced killing. Our findings provide first evidence that the nature of the second hit affects tumor immunosurveillance in c-MYC-driven lymphomas and define a potential shortcoming of antitumor therapies targeting BCL-2.

21889729	<TITLE>Reprint of: Theoretical and experimental basis of slow freezing.</TITLE>In human IVF, cryopreservation of oocytes has become an alternative to embryo storage. It has also shown enormous potential for oocyte donation, fertility preservation and animal biotechnology. Mouse oocytes have represented the elective model to develop oocyte cryopreservation in the human and over several decades their use has made possible the development of theoretical and empirical approaches. Progress in vitrification has overshadowed slow freezing to such an extent that it has been suggested that vitrification could soon become the exclusive cryopreservation choice in human IVF. However, recent studies have clearly indicated that human embryo slow freezing, a practice considered well established for decades, can be significantly improved by a simple empirical approach. Alternatively, recent and more advanced theoretical models can predict oocyte responses to the diverse factors characterizing an entire slow-freezing procedure, offering a global method for the improvement of current protocols. This gives credit to the notion that oocyte slow freezing still has considerable margins for improvement. In human IVF, cryopreservation of oocytes has become an alternative to embryo storage.

21906398	<TITLE>The impact of surgical outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy in elderly patients.</TITLE>The elderly population has increased in many countries. Indications for cancer treatment in elderly patients have expanded, because surgical techniques and medical management have improved remarkably. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) requires high-quality techniques and perioperative management methods. If it is possible for elderly patients to withstand an aggressive surgery, age should not be considered a contraindication for PD. Appropriate preoperative evaluation of elderly patients will lead to their safer management. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the safety of PD in patients older than 75 years and to show the influence of advanced age on the morbidity and mortality associated with this operation.|Subjects were 98 patients who underwent PD during the time period from April 2005 to April 2011. During this study, 31 patients were 75 years of age or older (group A), and the other 67 patients were less than 75 years old (group B). Preoperative demographic and clinical data, surgical procedure, pathologic diagnosis, postoperative course and complication details were collected prospectively and they were analyzed in two group.|There was no statistical difference between patient groups in terms of gender, comorbidity, preoperative drainage, diagnosis, or laboratory data. Preoperative albumin values were lower in group A (P = 0.04). The mean surgical time in group A was 408.1 ± 73.47 min. Blood loss and blood transfusion were not significantly different between both groups. There was no statistical differences in mortality rate (P = 0.14), morbidity rate (P = 0.43), and mean length of hospital stay (P = 0.22) between both groups. Long-term survival was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups using the log-rank test (P = 0.10).|It cannot be ignored that the elderly population is getting larger. We must investigate the management of elderly patients after PD and prepare further for more experiences of PD. If appropriate surgical management is provided to elderly patients, we suggest that PD will lead to no adverse effects after surgery, and PD can be performed safely in elderly patients. We conclude that age should not be a contraindication to PD.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
21911803	<TITLE>Sustained reduction of vein graft neointima formation by ex vivo TIMP-3 gene therapy.</TITLE>Coronary artery vein graft failure, resulting from thrombosis, intimal thickening, and atherosclerosis, is a significant clinical problem, with approximately 50% of vein grafts failing within 10 years. Intimal thickening is caused by migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima, where they proliferate. Interventions using gene transfer to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration are attractive because ex vivo access to the graft is possible. The involvement of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases in intimal thickening is well established, and we previously showed that adenoviral-delivered overexpression of an endogenous inhibitor, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), significantly retarded intimal thickening in short-term autologous porcine arteriovenous interposition grafts (28 days). However, it is essential to determine whether this approach will provide longer-term benefits.|We assessed whether a recombinant adenovirus that overexpresses TIMP-3 (RAdTIMP-3) affects vein graft intimal thickening in the longer term (at 3 months). Porcine saphenous veins were subjected to luminal infection with 2.5×10(10) pfu/mL RAdTIMP-3 or RAd60 (control virus) or vehicle control, for 30 minutes before implantation into the carotid artery. Analysis of grafts harvested 3 months after delivery revealed that RAdTIMP-3-infected grafts had significantly reduced intimal areas compared with both controls (3.2 ± 0.4 mm(2) versus 5.6 ± 0.7 mm(2) and 5.9 ± 0.5 mm(2), RAdTIMP-3, RAd60, and vehicle, respectively). Medial areas were also significantly decreased by TIMP-3 (3.8 ± 0.3 mm(2) versus 6.7 ± 1.0 mm(2) and 5.2 ± 0.4 mm(2), RAdTIMP-3, RAd60, and vehicle, respectively).|Overexpression of TIMP-3 provides a sustained retardation of vein graft intimal thickening and highlights the translational potential for ex vivo TIMP-3 gene therapy.

21917910	<TITLE>Dynamic and ligand-selective interactions of vitamin D receptor with retinoid X receptor and cofactors in living cells.</TITLE>The vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates vitamin D signaling in numerous physiological and pharmacological processes, including bone and calcium metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, immunity, and cardiovascular function. Although transcriptional regulation by VDR has been investigated intensively, an understanding of ligand-selective dynamic VDR conformations remains elusive. Here, we examined ligand-dependent dynamic interactions of VDR with retinoid X receptor (RXR), steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) in cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We compared the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], lithocholic acid (LCA), and (25R)-25-adamantyl-1α,25-dihydroxy-2-methylene-22,23-didehydro-19,26,27-trinor-20-epivitamin D(3) (ADTT), a partial agonist/antagonist vitamin D derivative. In the absence of ligand, VDR homodimers were preferred to RXR heterodimers and were associated with SMRT. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced heterodimerization with RXR, dissociation of SMRT, and association of SRC-1. LCA and ADTT induced those effects to a lesser extent at concentrations that did not induce expression of the VDR target gene CYP24A1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Unlike in HEK293 cells, ADTT increased CYP24A1 expression in HCT116 cells and increased the association of VDR and SMRT on the CYP24A1 promoter. The results indicate that ligand-selective conformation may lead to unique cofactor complex formation in a cell context-dependent manner. The combination of FRET and ChIP assays is a powerful tool useful in understanding ligand-selective dynamic VDR conformations and the development of selective VDR modulators.

21948330	<TITLE>Taxonomy and conservation of Vietnam's primates: a review.</TITLE>Vietnam has the highest number of primate taxa overall (24-27) and the highest number of globally threatened primate taxa (minimum 20) in Mainland Southeast Asia. Conservation management of these species depends in part on resolving taxonomic uncertainties, which remain numerous among the Asian primates. Recent research on genetic, morphological, and acoustic diversity in Vietnam's primates has clarified some of these uncertainties, although a number of significant classification issues still remain. Herein, we summarize and compare the major current taxonomic classifications of Vietnam's primates, discuss recent advances in the context of these taxonomies, and suggest key areas for additional research to best inform conservation efforts in a region crucial to global primate diversity. Among the most important next steps for the conservation of Vietnam's primates is a new consensus list of Asian primates that resolves current differences between major taxonomies, incorporates recent research advances, and recognizes units of diversity at scales below the species-level, whether termed populations, morphs, or subspecies. Priority should be placed on recognizing distinct populations, regardless of the species concept in use, in order to foster the evolutionary processes necessary for primate populations to cope with inevitable environmental changes. The long-term conservation of Vietnam's primates depends not only on an accepted and accurate taxonomy but also on funding for on-the-ground conservation activities, including training, and the continued dedication and leadership of Vietnamese researchers and managers.

22020435	<TITLE>CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses in selected patients.</TITLE>We analysed our experience with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) in patients who were not surgical candidates or refused surgery for small to medium-sized renal masses.|Two freezing cycles were applied and separated by a passive warming cycle using 1.7- and 2.4-mm cryoprobes under either general anaesthesia or sedation based on patient positioning and respiratory status. Postoperative monitoring included haematological and biochemistry evaluation and CT scan 24 h after PCA. Follow-up consisted of a multislice CT scan at 1 month and every 3 months in the first year then every 6 months thereafter.|Thirty-seven patients (38 lesions) underwent 40 PCA procedures; 5/37 (13.5%) had a solitary kidney. Median mass size was 35 (range 12-70) mm. No complications occurred during the procedure. Clavien grade ≥2 anaemia occurred in two patients (5.4 %): one patient required 1 U of packed red blood cells; the other required an arterial embolisation. Serum creatinine did not increase in any case. Two patients showed persisting or recurrent disease at 1 and 9 months, respectively, and both could be re-treated with PCA. All other patients showed a hypodense mass 3 months after PCA, with no contrast enhancement. Subsequent examinations showed that lesion sizes decreased and CT densitometry remained stable or increased minimally, also with no contrast enhancement.|PCA proved relatively easy and safe and could be considered an effective alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates or refuse surgery, as well as in patients with medium-sized lesions.

22040715	<TITLE>Mortality in patients with hip fracture aged over 90 years: a report from a progressively aging island.</TITLE>In our aging society, hip fractures are common in elderly patients, especially those aged above 90 years. Improving mortality rates after this injury is an important part of medical management for the elderly. This study assessed mortality rates after hip fracture in patients aged ≥90 years and examined factors that contribute to mortality.|Between April 2003 and March 2009, 186 patients aged ≥65 years were studied. Of these, 50 patients were aged ≥90 years. Walking ability before injury and at discharge, preoperative physical status, number of comorbidities, postoperative survival, sex, fracture type, and patients' residential status were investigated.|One-year mortality was higher in patients aged ≥90 years (24%) than in younger patients (10%) (p=0.01). Moreover, older patients were less likely to retain walking ability at discharge, and poor postoperative ambulatory levels were associated with increased mortality. Preoperative physical status according to the grading system of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) did not differ between the two age groups. Poor ASA grade was associated with mortality in the entire population, but this association was not significant in the older group. Although older patients had a higher number of trochanteric fractures, fracture type and mortality did not significantly correlate with age.|Acceptable outcomes of hip fracture surgery can be achieved in very old patients. In addition, postoperative ambulatory level may be a predictor of mortality.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

In order to address the issue of how women integrate PTG in their overall cancer experience, 28 open interviews concerning changes after cancer were carried out with 5- to 15-year survivors. The analysis of results, performed using Alceste software, revealed one thematic class of PTG which was specific to women with high coping and social support and active cognitive processing. PTG theme appeared most often as a conclusion of interviews rather than in response to the question about changes after cancer.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
22144265	<TITLE>Rho GTPases: deciphering the evolutionary history of a complex protein family.</TITLE>Rho GTPases constitute a significant subgroup of the eukaryotic Ras superfamily of small GTPases implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, such as the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, establishment, and maintenance of cell polarity and membrane trafficking. Whereas a few eukaryotes lack Rho genes, a majority of species typically bear multiple Rho paralogs, raising a question about the origin of the family and the paths of its diversification in individual eukaryotic lineages. In this chapter, we ruminate on several aspects of the evolutionary history of the Rho family and methodological challenges of its reconstruction. First, we provide an updated survey of Rho GTPases in diverse eukaryotic branches, demonstrating almost ubiquitous occurrence of Rho genes across the eukaryotic phylogeny most consistent with the presence of at least one Rho gene already in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Second, we discuss the obstacles in reconstructing the history of gene duplications giving rise to the extant diversity of Rho paralogs in different species, and point to numerous limitations posed by the current phylogenetic methodology. Third, as a case study demonstrating various issues of data collection, phylogenetic analyses and interpretations of trees, we present an analysis of the Rho family in the fungal kingdom, revealing the existence of at least four separate paralogs (Cdc42, Rac, Rho1, and Rho4) in early fungi and subsequent potentially independent expansions of the family in different fungal subgroups. We conclude with the warning that the currently dominating perception of the Rho phylogeny is biased by the metazoan (and especially vertebrate) perspective, and a new, more global view is to be worked out when a better genome sampling and more adequate methods of phylogenetic inference are employed.

22163126	<TITLE>Long-term follow-up of iatrogenic atrial septal defect: after percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty.</TITLE>During percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty, the Inoue method leaves patients with an iatrogenic atrial septal defect. In this study, we evaluated the factors affecting the development of iatrogenic atrial septal defect and searched for the possible influence of this defect on long-term outcomes.We reviewed the medical records of 267 patients who had undergone successful percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty for symptomatic moderate or severe mitral stenosis from January 2000 through March 2004. Sixty-three of the 267 patients were enrolled in a face-to-face follow-up study. We noted their clinical and demographic characteristics. All included patients were asked for the endpoints of repeat percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty or mitral valve surgery, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and the need of intervention for the iatrogenic atrial septal defect. They underwent standard 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examination. The presence of iatrogenic atrial septal defect was evaluated via the color-Doppler technique in the subcostal view and via contrast echocardiography.Patients were subclassified in accordance with the presence (n = 15) or absence (n = 48) of echocardiographically proven persistent iatrogenic atrial septal defect. When we compared the 2 groups, there were no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics or in pre- and postprocedural echocardiographic data.We conclude that the presence of persistent iatrogenic atrial septal defects might not be predicted from echocardiographic or demographic data in patients undergoing percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty. Fortunately, these defects are small in size and low in shunt ratio. They appear not to be associated with serious long-term outcomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
22229845	<TITLE>Transport mechanisms in capillary condensation of water at a single-asperity nanoscopic contact.</TITLE>Transport mechanisms involved in capillary condensation of water menisci in nanoscopic gaps between hydrophilic surfaces are investigated theoretically and experimentally by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of capillary force. The measurements showed an instantaneous formation of a water meniscus by coalescence of the water layers adsorbed on the AFM tip and sample surfaces, followed by a time evolution of meniscus toward a stationary state corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium. This dynamics of the water meniscus is indicated by time evolution of the meniscus force, which increases with the contact time toward its equilibrium value. Two water transport mechanisms competing in this meniscus dynamics are considered: (1) Knudsen diffusion and condensation of water molecules in the nanoscopic gap and (2) adsorption of water molecules on the surface region around the contact and flow of the surface water toward the meniscus. For the case of very hydrophilic surfaces, the dominant role of surface water transportation on the meniscus dynamics is supported by the results of the AFM measurements of capillary force of water menisci formed at sliding tip-sample contacts. These measurements revealed that fast movement of the contact impedes on the formation of menisci at thermodynamic equilibrium because the flow of the surface water is too slow to reach the moving meniscus.

22277626	<TITLE>A computer simulation study to evaluate resistance development with a derquantel-abamectin combination on UK sheep farms.</TITLE>UK guidelines for the sustainable control of parasites in sheep (SCOPS) aim to delay further development of anthelmintic drug resistance. This study describes a computer model evaluation of resistance development with a novel oral formulation of derquantel-abamectin, to inform recommendations for use. Two different farm management scenarios, based on UK field data, were modelled to simulate low refugia (non SCOPS) or high refugia (SCOPS) worm populations. The effect on resistance allele frequencies and field efficacy of several treatment scenarios using the novel active derquantel (DQL), a spiroindole (SI), as either a single or multiple active formulation with abamectin (ABA), a macrocyclic lactone (ML), under the two farm management systems was evaluated. The initial resistance allele frequency for DQL was set at 0.0001, assuming that resistance in the UK is low, and for ML at 0.165 or 0.8, assuming that resistant nematode populations exist in the UK. DQL resistance reached a level at which a reduction in field efficacy might be detected (resistance allele frequency 0.25) by year 16 when used sequentially, and by year 31 when used in annual rotation (ABA) with SCOPS management inputs, and by year 5 (sequential) and by year 10 (annual rotation) with non SCOPS management inputs. ML resistance reached a level at which a reduction in ABA field efficacy might be detected (resistance allele frequency 0.25) by year 4 when used sequentially, and by year 8 when used in annual rotation with DQL and SCOPS management inputs, and by year 1 (sequential) and by year 2 (annual rotation) with non SCOPS management inputs. No detectable reduction in field efficacy was observed for DQL-ABA after 40 years of use with SCOPS management inputs for simulations using an initial ML resistance allele frequency of 0.165 and 0.8. A detectable reduction in field efficacy was observed for DQL-ABA by year 32 (initial ML resistance allele frequency=0.165) and by year 6 (initial ML resistance allele frequency=0.8) with non SCOPS management inputs. In summary, the results suggest that formulating DQL in combination with ABA confers a substantial advantage in delaying the development of both DQL and ML resistance, and the provision of adequate refugia further extends this advantage.

The authors identified five such craniofacial techniques and queried American Society of Plastic Surgeons members and plastic surgery program directors regarding their comfort level with the procedures and their opinion on resident training for these selected procedures.|First, a select group of senior craniofacial surgeons discussed and agreed on the top five procedures. Second, active American Society of Plastic Surgeons were surveyed regarding their opinion on training and their comfort level with each procedure. Third, plastic surgery residency program directors were studied to see which of the top five procedures are taught as part of the plastic surgery residency curriculum.|The top five widely applicable craniofacial procedures are technically described and include the following: (1) cranial or iliac bone graft for nasal reconstruction, (2) perialar rim bone graft, (3) lateral canthopexy, (4) osseous genioplasty, and (5) bone graft harvest for orbital floor defects. For practicing plastic surgeons, comfort level in all procedures increased with advancing years in practice (except those with <5 years). A majority of plastic surgeons (>75 percent), especially those with craniofacial fellowship training, felt competent in all procedures except osseous genioplasty (53 percent). Plastic surgery program directors agreed that all top five procedures should be mastered by graduation.|Although program directors felt that all five selected craniofacial procedures should be taught and mastered during residency training, plastic surgeons without craniofacial fellowship training were less comfortable with the techniques. Residency training goals should include competence in core craniofacial techniques.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Patients with node-negative gastric cancer presented better survival. However, some of them would die of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of patients with node-negative gastric cancer.|From 1996 to 2007, 4,426 patients had undergone curative D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Patients with node-negative gastric cancer who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy with more than 15 lymph nodes dissected were selected into this study.

The factors correlating significantly with overall survival on univariate analysis included age (P = 0.016), depth of invasion (P = 0.000), tumor size (P = 0.013), tumor site (P = 0.000), histological grade (P = 0.009), lymphatic tumor emboli (P = 0.014), vascular tumor emboli (P = 0.005), and nervous invasion (P = 0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that lymphatic tumor emboli (hazard ratio (HR) = 7.270), vascular tumor emboli (HR = 3.010), and depth of invasion (HR = 2.735) were defined as independent prognostic factors.|Among patients with node-negative gastric cancer and higher risk for recurrence, the use of adjuvant therapies should be considered.

22611057	<TITLE>Molecular interaction databases.</TITLE>Molecular interaction databases are playing an ever more important role in our understanding of the biology of the cell. An increasing number of resources exist to provide these data and many of these have adopted the controlled vocabularies and agreed-upon standardised data formats produced by the Molecular Interaction workgroup of the Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO PSI-MI). Use of these standards allows each resource to establish PSI Common QUery InterfaCe (PSICQUIC) service, making data from multiple resources available to the user in response to a single query. This cooperation between databases has been taken a stage further, with the establishment of the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium which aims to maximise the curation power of numerous data resources, and provide the user with a non-redundant, consistently annotated set of interaction data.

22653591	<TITLE>Stable expression and  integrated hepatitis B virus genome in a human hepatoma cell line.</TITLE>HepG2.2.15  cell is a widely used cell model for studying HBV (hepatitis B virus) in  vitro. In these cells, the HBV genome is integrated in several sites of  HepG2 cellular DNA. These multiple copies may have some influence on the  cellular processes. We constructed a new plasmid, pSEH-Flag-HBV, and  transfected it into HepG2 cells, and then screened it with hygromycin. We then  used ELISA, PCR, and RT-PCR to detect the expression of HBV in these cell  lines. A cell line that stably expressed hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was established. Using Southern blotting  analysis, we found that the HBV genome was integrated as a single copy in the  cellular DNA. This cell line will be a useful alternative model for HBV  studies.

22709790	<TITLE>Overexpression of ribosome binding protein 1 (RRBP1) in breast cancer.</TITLE>The molecular events that lead to malignant transformation and subsequent metastasis of breast carcinoma include alterations in the cells at genome, transcriptome and proteome levels. In this study, we used publicly available gene expression databases to identify those candidate genes which are upregulated at the mRNA level in breast cancers but have not been systematically validated at the protein level. Based on an extensive literature search, we identified ribosome binding protein 1 (RRBP1) as a candidate that is upregulated at the mRNA level in five different studies but its protein expression had not been investigated. Immunohistochemical labeling of breast cancer tissue microarrays was carried out to determine the expression of RRBP1 in a large panel of breast cancers. We found that RRBP1 was overexpressed in 84% (177/219) of breast carcinoma cases tested. The subcellular localization of RRBP1 was mainly observed to be in the cytoplasm with intense staining in the perinuclear region. Our findings suggest that RRBP1 is an interesting molecule that can be further studied for its potential to serve as a breast cancer biomarker. This study also demonstrates how the integration of biological data from available resources in conjunction with systematic evaluation approaches can be successfully applied to clinical proteomics.

22715953	<TITLE>Hyperferritinemia in the critically ill child with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/sepsis/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome/macrophage activation syndrome: what is the treatment?</TITLE>Hyperferritinemia is associated with increased mortality in pediatric sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and critical illness. The International Histiocyte Society has recommended that children with hyperferritinemia and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) should be treated with the same immunosuppressant/cytotoxic therapies used to treat primary HLH. We hypothesized that patients with hyperferritinemia associated secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS can be successfully treated with a less immunosuppressant approach than is recommended for primary HLH.|We conducted a multi-center cohort study of children in Turkish Pediatric Intensive Care units with hyperferritinemia associated secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS treated with less immunosuppression (plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin or methyl prednisolone) or with the primary HLH protocol (plasma exchange and dexamethasone or cyclosporine A and/or etoposide). The primary outcome assessed was hospital survival.|Twenty-three children with hyperferritinemia and secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS were enrolled (median ferritin = 6341 μg/dL, median number of organ failures = 5). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that use of plasma exchange and methyl prednisolone or intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 17, survival 100%) was associated with improved survival compared to plasma exchange and dexamethasone and/or cyclosporine and/or etoposide (n = 6, survival 50%) (P = 0.002).|Children with hyperferritinemia and secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS can be successfully treated with plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisone. Randomized trials are required to evaluate if the HLH-94 protocol is helpful or harmful compared to this less immune suppressive and cytotoxic approach in this specific population.

22747528	<TITLE>Fourier-transform infrared study of the photoactivation process of Xenopus (6-4) photolyase.</TITLE>Photolyases (PHRs) are blue light-activated DNA repair enzymes that maintain genetic integrity by reverting UV-induced photoproducts into normal bases. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore of PHRs has four different redox states: oxidized (FAD(ox)), anion radical (FAD(•-)), neutral radical (FADH(•)), and fully reduced (FADH(-)). We combined difference Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with UV-visible spectroscopy to study the detailed photoactivation process of Xenopus (6-4) PHR. Two photons produce the enzymatically active, fully reduced PHR from oxidized FAD: FAD(ox) is converted to semiquinone via light-induced one-electron and one-proton transfers and then to FADH(-) by light-induced one-electron transfer. We successfully trapped FAD(•-) at 200 K, where electron transfer occurs but proton transfer does not. UV-visible spectroscopy following 450 nm illumination of FAD(ox) at 277 K defined the FADH(•)/FADH(-) mixture and allowed calculation of difference FTIR spectra among the four redox states. The absence of a characteristic C=O stretching vibration indicated that the proton donor is not a protonated carboxylic acid. Structural changes in Trp and Tyr are suggested by UV-visible and FTIR analysis of FAD(•-) at 200 K. Spectral analysis of amide I vibrations revealed structural perturbation of the protein's β-sheet during initial electron transfer (FAD(•-) formation), a transient increase in α-helicity during proton transfer (FADH(•) formation), and reversion to the initial amide I signal following subsequent electron transfer (FADH(-) formation). Consequently, in (6-4) PHR, unlike cryptochrome-DASH, formation of enzymatically active FADH(-) did not perturb α-helicity. Protein structural changes in the photoactivation of (6-4) PHR are discussed on the basis of these FTIR observations.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
22773987	<TITLE>Comparison of central macular thickness between two spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in elderly non-mydriatic eyes.</TITLE>To compare central macular thickness (CMT) measurements obtained by two spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) exams, and to evaluate measurement reproducibility and agreement between these two exams, and to investigate the relationship between CMT and possible influencing factors such as age, sex, eye (OD/OS), and operators in elderly non-mydriatic eyes.|Seventy-two normal subjects were included. Every subject underwent CMT measurement twice using one of two SD-OCT (OSE-2000, Moptim, Shenzhen, China & 3-D OCT-1000, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) instruments respectively where we randomly chose one eye in each patient for the test; these exams were performed by two operators over an hour period with a brief rest between sessions. Comparison of the OSE-2000 and 3-D OCT-1000 CMT measurements was based on paired-t test. The mean difference between the CMT measurements was calculated. General linear model analyzed the relationships among eye (OD/OS), operator, sex, and CMT values using age as co-variant. All tests were considered statistically significant at P<0.05. The main outcome measures included CMT.|When evaluated with general linear model analysis, CMT measurements were found to have high reproducibility across the two instruments between the two operators for the OSE-2000 single line scan and 3-D OCT-1000 macular scans (P=0.731; P=0.443). There was statistically significant difference in CMT values between the two instruments (P<0.001) and the mean difference was -46.83µm at 95% confidence limits (-49.15,-44.51). Age was positively correlated with CMT (beta coefficient = 0.516, P=0.001; beta coefficient = 0.453, P=0.009) and sex was correlated with CMT from the OSE-2000 (P=0.021) but not with the 3-D OCT-1000 (P=0.056). According to the actual thickness measurements, the CMT of the male was thicker than the female's but there was no statistical difference. There was interaction between sex and eye in OSE-2000 and not in 3-D OCT-1000 (P=0.02; P=0.374). No significant correlation was found between CMT and the influencing factor of eye in both of the instruments (P=0.884; P=0.492).|Reproducibility of CMT measurement using the two SD-OCTs is excellent in normal eyes according to the operator factor analysis. OSE-2000 has a different posterior retinal boundary of CMT measurement, which results in the CMT value differences, compared with the 3-D OCT-1000. Age is positively correlated with CMT measurement while sex is correlated with CMT in the OSE-2000 but not in the 3-D OCT-1000 and eye (OD/OS) had no correlation with CMT values. Mydriatic drops may not be necessary for CMT measurement using high scan rate SD-OCT in normal eyes in dark room.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
22879752	<TITLE>Researching Prescription Drug Misuse among First Nations in Canada: Starting from a Health Promotion Framework.</TITLE>The intentional misuse of psychotropic drugs is recognized as a significant public health concern in Canada, although there is a lack of empirical research detailing this. Even less research has been documented on the misuse of prescription drugs among First Nations in Canada. In the past, Western biomedical and individual-based approaches to researching Indigenous health have been applied, whereas First Nations' understandings of health are founded on a holistic view of wellbeing. Recognition of this disjuncture, alongside the protective influence of First Nations traditional culture, is foundational to establishing an empirical understanding of and comprehensive response to prescription drug misuse. We propose health promotion as a framework from which to begin to explore this. Our work with a health promotion framework has conveyed its potential to support the consideration of Western and Indigenous worldviews together in an 'ethical space', with illustrations provided. Health promotion also allots for the consideration of Canada's colonial history of knowledge production in public health and supports First Nations' self-determination. Based on this, we recommend three immediate ways in which a health promotion framework can advance research on prescription drug misuse among First Nations in Canada.

22931895	<TITLE>Integrative molecular phylogeography in the context of infectious diseases on the human-animal interface.</TITLE>The rate of new emerging infectious diseases entering the human population has increased over the past century, with pathogens originating from animals or from products of animal origin accounting for the vast majority. Primary risk factors for the emergence and spread of emerging zoonoses include expansion and intensification of animal agriculture and long-distance live animal transport, live animal markets, bushmeat consumption and habitat destruction. Developing effective control strategies is contingent upon the ability to test causative hypotheses of disease transmission within a statistical framework. Broadly speaking, molecular phylogeography offers a framework in which specific hypotheses regarding pathogen gene flow and dispersal within an ecological context can be compared. A number of different methods has been developed for this application. Here, our intent is firstly to discuss the application of a wide variety of statistically based methods (including Bayesian reconstruction, network parsimony analysis and regression) to specific viruses (influenza, salmon anaemia virus, foot and mouth disease and Rift Valley Fever) that have been associated with animal farming/movements; and secondly to place them in the larger framework of the threat of potential zoonotic events as well as the economic and biosecurity implications of pathogen outbreaks among our animal food sources.

22936565	<TITLE>Survivin expression can predict the effect of chemoradiotherapy for advanced lower rectal cancer.</TITLE>Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been used to improve local control and survival in patients with advanced rectal carcinoma. However, a significant proportion of patients show poor response to adjuvant CRT. We thus investigated the usefulness of survivin expression as a predictive marker of the CRT response and its characteristics.|Forty-three patients with lower rectal cancer who underwent CRT were investigated. All patients received preoperative CRT consisting of TS-1 concurrent with 40 Gy of pelvic irradiation followed by curative resection. The relationship between clinical response, or pathological response, and the expression of survivin of pre-CRT biopsy specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and compared with post-CRT expression.|Positive expression of survivin was observed in 26 of 43 patients (60%) in pre-CRT specimens. Survivin was positively expressed in 77% of stable disease cases, and 43% of partial response (p < 0.05). Regarding the correlation between pathological response and survivin expression, positive expression of survivin was recognized in 75% (18 of 24) of Grade 0 + 1 cases, 50% (7 of 14) of Grade 2 cases, and 20% (1 of 5) of Grade 3 cases. A reverse correlation was recognized between pathological responses and survivin expression (p < 0.05). There were differences in the tumor differentiation between the survivin-positive group and the negative group (p < 0.05). The expression concordance rate was 66% between pre- and post-CRT tissues. In post-CRT tissues, nuclear survivin expression disappeared completely and cytoplasmic expression increased, especially in responder cases.|Survivin expression in biopsy could be an important predictive factor of preoperative CRT response.

They show that the GTPase-activating protein, CYK4, suppresses equatorial cell substrate adhesion by inhibiting Rac and therefore its effectors ARFGEF7 and PAK1/2.

22981434	<TITLE>Dissociation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus neutralization from antibodies specific to major envelope protein surface epitopes.</TITLE>Glycoprotein 5 (GP5) and membrane (M) protein are the major proteins in the envelope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Although viral neutralization epitopes are reported in GP5 and M of type 2 PRRSV, their significance as targets of porcine humoral immunity is not well described. Thus, we constructed recombinant polypeptides containing ectodomain neutralization epitopes to examine their involvement in porcine antibody neutralization and antiviral immunity. PRRSV infection elicited ectodomain-specific antibodies, whose titers did not correlate with the neutralizing antibody (NA) response. Ectodomain-specific antibodies from PRRSV-neutralizing serum bound virus but did not neutralize infectivity. Furthermore, immunization of pigs with ectodomain polypeptides raised specific antibodies and provided partial protection without a detectable NA response. Finally the polypeptides did not block infection of porcine macrophages. These results suggest that the GP5/M ectodomain peptide epitopes are accessible for host antibody recognition, but are not associated with antibody-mediated virus neutralization.

23105692	<TITLE>Hospital based preliminary study on osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.</TITLE>The awareness of osteoporosis has grown world wide in recent years. This silently progressing metabolic bone disease is widely prevalent in India, and osteoporotic fractures are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in adult Indian men and women. Rapid bone loss occurs in postmenopausal women due to hormonal factors which lead to increased risk of fractures. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism are used to assess skeletal turnover. A cross-sectional study of 150 pre- and post menopausal women was carried out at S.D.M College of Medical Sciences and Hospital, Dharwad, during the period of May 2005 to September 2005. The study group consisted of 75 Premenopausal women in the age group of 25-45 years and 75 Postmenopausal women in the age group of 46-65 years. Bone formation markers (Total Calcium, lonised calcium, Phosphorus, Alkaline phosphatase), and bone resorption markers (Urinary Hydroxyproline) were analysed in pre and post menopausal women. Bone formation markers, Total and lonised calcium were significantly decreased (p<0.001) and Alkaline phosphatase was significantly increased (p<0.001) in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women. Bone resorption markers, Urinary hydroxyproline excretion was significantly increased (p<0.001) in postmenopausal women. The results from this study suggest that simple, easy, common biochemical markers can still be used to assess the bone turnover in postmenopausal women and hence their risk of developing osteoporosis and fractures.

23151354	<TITLE>Kiwifruit consumption favourably affects plasma lipids in a randomised controlled trial in hypercholesterolaemic men.</TITLE>The unique composition of green kiwifruit has the potential to benefit CVD risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of consuming two green kiwifruits daily in conjunction with a healthy diet on plasma lipids and other metabolic markers and to examine response according to APOE genotype in hypercholesterolaemic men. After undergoing a 4-week healthy diet, eighty-five hypercholesterolaemic men (LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) > 3.0 mmol/l and TAG < 3 mmol/l) completed an 8-week randomised controlled cross-over study of two 4-week intervention sequences of two green kiwifruits per d plus healthy diet (intervention) or healthy diet alone (control). Anthropometric measures, blood pressure (BP) and fasting blood samples (plasma lipids, serum apoA1 and apoB, insulin, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) were taken at baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks. After the kiwifruit intervention, plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were significantly higher (mean difference 0.04; 95% CI 0.01, 0.07 mmol/l; P = 0.004) and the total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C ratio was significantly lower (mean difference 20.5; 95% CI 20.24, 20.05 mmol/l; P = 0.002) compared with the control. In carriers of the APOE4 allele, TAG decreased significantly (mean difference -0.18; 95% CI -0.34, -0.02 mol/l; P = 0.03) with kiwifruit compared with control. There were no significant differences between the two interventions for plasma TC, LDL-C, insulin, glucose, hs-CRP and BP. The small but significant increase in HDL-C and decrease in TC:HDL-C ratio and TAG (in APOE4 carriers) suggest that the regular inclusion of green kiwifruit as part of a healthy diet may be beneficial in improving the lipid profiles of men with high cholesterol.

23227907	<TITLE>Microfluidic paper-based analytical device for aerosol oxidative activity.</TITLE>Human exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been linked with respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to various cancers. Consistent among all of these associations is the hypothesis that PM induces inflammation and oxidative stress in the affected tissue. Consequently, a variety of assays have been developed to quantify the oxidative activity of PM as a means to characterize its ability to induced oxidative stress. The vast majority of these assays rely on high-volume, fixed-location sampling methods due to limitations in assay sensitivity and detection limit. As a result, our understanding of how personal exposure contributes to the intake of oxidative air pollution is limited. To further this understanding, we present a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) for measuring PM oxidative activity on filters collected by personal sampling. The μPAD is inexpensive to fabricate and provides fast and sensitive analysis of aerosol oxidative activity. The oxidative activity measurement is based on the dithiothreitol assay (DTT assay), uses colorimetric detection, and can be completed in the field within 30 min following sample collection. The μPAD assay was validated against the traditional DTT assay using 13 extracted aerosol samples including urban aerosols, biomass burning PM, cigarette smoke, and incense smoke. The results showed no significant differences in DTT consumption rate measured by the two methods. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, personal samples were collected to estimate human exposures to PM from indoor air, outdoor air on a clean day, and outdoor air on a wildfire-impacted day in Fort Collins, CO. Filter samples collected on the wildfire day gave the highest oxidative activity on a mass normalized basis, whereas typical ambient background air showed the lowest oxidative activity.

She had previously resided in Hunan Province, China, and Myanmar, and she immigrated to Taiwan 30 years ago. Colonoscopy revealed a colonic ulcer. Biopsy of the colonic ulcer showed ulceration of the colonic mucosa, and many Paragonimus westermani-like eggs were noted. Serum IgG antibody levels showed strong reactivity with P. westermani excretory-secretory antigens by ELISA. Intestinal paragonimiasis was thus diagnosed according to the morphology of the eggs and serologic finding. After treatment with praziquantel, hematochezia resolved. The present case illustrates the extreme manifestations encountered in severe intestinal paragonimiasis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23297845	<TITLE>Endoscopic resection for gastric epithelial neoplasia: how to solve pathological discrepancy and achieve curative resection?</TITLE>Endoscopic resection (ER) was introduced to China from Japan, while most pathologists are influenced by Western criteria. Japanese and Western pathologists have debated for decades how best to distinguish between gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (GIEN) and early gastric cancer (EGC). In this study we aimed to find out how to solve this pathological discrepancy and improve the curative resection of lesions based on our experiences.|In total, 143 patients with GIEN or EGC were treated by ER in our hospital from April 2008 to April 2012. The risk factors related to the degree of malignancy of the lesions and the non-curability of ER were analyzed. Pathological discrepancy between forceps biopsies and ER specimens was also compared.|According to the histological types of the ER specimens, there were 67 patients with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), 35 with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and 41 with EGC. The ER histological type was significantly correlated with gender, ER method, macroscopic type, tumor size, ulcer and histological type of the forceps biopsy (P < 0.05). The discrepancy between forceps biopsy and ER specimens was 41.3% (59/143). Furthermore, the depth of tumor invasion and ER histological type were associated with the curative resection of HGIN and EGC (P < 0.05).|The pathological discrepancy shows that patients with HGIN in forceps biopsy should be considered candidates for ER. The risk factors of lesion malignancy and ER curability indicate the great importance of pretreatment evaluation for ER.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23346095	<TITLE>Dysregulated A to I RNA editing and non-coding RNAs in neurodegeneration.</TITLE>RNA editing is an alteration in the primary nucleotide sequences resulting from a chemical change in the base. RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). The most common RNA editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I). Studies from ADAR (adenosine deaminase that act on RNA) mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mice clearly show that the RNA editing process is an absolute requirement for nervous system homeostasis and normal physiology of the animal. Understanding the mechanisms of editing and findings of edited substrates has provided a better knowledge of the phenotype due to defective and hyperactive RNA editing. A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of enzymes knows as ADARs. ADARs modify duplex RNAs and editing of duplex RNAs formed by ncRNAs can impact RNA functions, leading to an altered regulatory gene network. Such altered functions by A to I editing is observed in mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) but other editing of small and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) has yet to be identified. Thus, ncRNA and RNA editing may provide key links between neural development, nervous system function, and neurological diseases. This review includes a summary of seminal findings regarding the impact of ncRNAs on biological and pathological processes, which may be further modified by RNA editing. NcRNAs are non-translated RNAs classified by size and function. Known ncRNAs like miRNAs, smallRNAs (smRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and lncRNAs play important roles in splicing, DNA methylation, imprinting, and RNA interference. Of note, miRNAs are involved in development and function of the nervous system that is heavily dependent on both RNA editing and the intricate spatiotemporal expression of ncRNAs. This review focuses on the impact of dysregulated A to I editing and ncRNAs in neurodegeneration.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

After cavities were restored with an adhesive systems and composite resin, they were submitted to thermocycling procedures. Teeth were divided into four sub-groups according to the bleaching systems (control, at-home bleaching, chemically activated office bleaching and KTP laser-activated office bleaching). After the bleaching procedure, teeth were evaluated for marginal leakage. All data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.05).|The results of the present study showed that the control group presented lower microleakage values compared with the groups treated with bleaching agents, except for the chemically activated in-office bleaching. When the scores of microleakage at the enamel and gingival margins of the four groups were compared, the differences among the groups were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Comparing the gingival and enamel margins in each group, statistically significant differences were found in the at-home group (p < 0.05) and no significant differences were seen in the other groups (p > 0.05). No significant difference was found between the adhesive systems after treatment with the same bleaching techniques.|Under the conditions of this study, microleakage of composite resin restorations differs according to the bleaching methods used and no difference was found between the adhesive systems.

Finally, the developed duties and tasks were validated for importance, difficulty, and frequency.|A CRC is defined as the one who coordinates and performs tasks related to clinical research/trials among investigators, participants, and sponsors according to the Good Clinical Practice at institutions conducting clinical trials. Twelve duties and 78 tasks were identified on the DACUM chart which represented the importance, difficulty, and frequency of tasks represented as A, B, and C respectively. Based on determinant coefficient (DC) of the task, the highest ranked task was confirming the eligibility of participants for research (DC=8.03) and the lowest was inventory management for clinical study materials (3.95).|In this study, the job of a CRC was analyzed through the DACUM process and it was found that CRCs were doing various duties and tasks.

23390199	<TITLE>Occupational asthma and occupational rhinitis: the united airways disease model revisited.</TITLE>Whereas accumulating evidence indicates close associations between rhinitis and asthma, little is known about the relationships between occupational rhinitis (OR) and occupational asthma (OA). This study analyses the prevalence of OR associated with OA, globally and according to the various causal agents, and investigates the temporal relationships between these two conditions.|Data on incident cases of OA (2008-2010) were collected through the French national occupational disease surveillance and prevention network, using a standardised form including information on occupation, causal agents, presence of OR, and respective dates of occurrence of rhinitis and asthma.|Among the 596 reported OA cases with latency period, 555 could be attributed to identified agents: high molecular weight (HMW) agents (n=174); low molecular weight (LMW) agents (n=381). Overall, OR was associated with OA in 324 (58.4%) cases. The frequency of association was significantly higher for HMW agents than for LMW agents (72.2% vs 51.5%, p<0.001). OR occurred before OA significantly more frequently for HMW agents than for LMW agents (p<0.01).|These results show that OR is frequently associated with OA, especially when HMW agents are involved. They are consistent with the hypothesis that OR, in conjunction with OA, is more likely to be caused by sensitisers that cause disease via IgE-mediated mechanisms and suggest that symptoms of OR should be taken into account in the medical surveillance of workers exposed to HMW agents.

23405963	<TITLE>Pseudo-single-crystal electrochemistry on polycrystalline electrodes: visualizing activity at grains and grain boundaries on platinum for the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction.</TITLE>The influence of electrode surface structure on electrochemical reaction rates and mechanisms is a major theme in electrochemical research, especially as electrodes with inherent structural heterogeneities are used ubiquitously. Yet, probing local electrochemistry and surface structure at complex surfaces is challenging. In this paper, high spatial resolution scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) complemented with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is demonstrated as a means of performing 'pseudo-single-crystal' electrochemical measurements at individual grains of a polycrystalline platinum electrode, while also allowing grain boundaries to be probed. Using the Fe(2+/3+) couple as an illustrative case, a strong correlation is found between local surface structure and electrochemical activity. Variations in electrochemical activity for individual high index grains, visualized in a weakly adsorbing perchlorate medium, show that there is higher activity on grains with a significant (101) orientation contribution, compared to those with (001) and (111) contribution, consistent with findings on single-crystal electrodes. Interestingly, for Fe(2+) oxidation in a sulfate medium a different pattern of activity emerges. Here, SECCM reveals only minor variations in activity between individual grains, again consistent with single-crystal studies, with a greatly enhanced activity at grain boundaries. This suggests that these sites may contribute significantly to the overall electrochemical behavior measured on the macroscale.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23419043	<TITLE>Chimera of IL-2 linked to light chain of anti-IL-2 mAb mimics IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes both structurally and functionally.</TITLE>IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb immunocomplexes were described to have dramatically higher activity than free IL-2 in vivo. We designed protein chimera consisting of IL-2 linked to light chain of anti-IL-2 mAb S4B6 through flexible oligopeptide spacer (Gly(4)Ser)(3). This protein chimera mimics the structure of IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes but eliminates general disadvantages of immunocomplexes like possible excess of either IL-2 or anti-IL-2 mAb and their dissociation to antibody and IL-2 at low concentrations. This novel kind of protein chimera is characterized by an intramolecular interaction between IL-2 and binding site of S4B6 mAb similarly as in IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes. Our protein chimera has biological activity comparable to IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes in vitro, as shown by stimulation of proliferation of purified and activated OT-I CD8(+) T cells. The protein chimera exerts higher stimulatory activity to drive expansion of purified CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8(+) T cells activated by an injection of a low dose of SIINFEKL peptide than IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes in vivo.

23436910	<TITLE>A randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture self-needling as maintenance therapy for cancer-related fatigue after therapist-delivered acupuncture.</TITLE>Maintenance acupuncture is advocated by clinicians after successful clinic-based acupuncture. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of maintenance acupuncture in the management of cancer-related fatigue (CRF); treatment delivered by therapists or self-acupuncture/self-needling was compared with no maintenance treatment.|Breast cancer patients who participated in a randomized trial of acupuncture for CRF management (reported elsewhere) were re-randomized to receive an additional four acupuncturist-delivered weekly sessions; four self-administered weekly acupuncture sessions (self-needling); or no acupuncture. Primary outcome was general fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Mood, quality of life and safety were also assessed.|In total, 197 patients were re-randomized, with 65 to therapist-delivered sessions, 67 to self-acupuncture/self-needling and 65 to no further acupuncture. Primary outcome scores were equivalent between the therapist-delivered acupuncture and self-acupuncture (P > 0.05). A non-significant trend in improving fatigue was observed at the end of 4 weeks in the combined acupuncture arms (P = 0.07). There was no impact on mood or quality of life of the further acupuncture sessions at 18 weeks beyond the improvement observed in initial trial.|Self-acupuncture is an acceptable, feasible and safe maintenance treatment for patients with CRF. However, overall, maintenance acupuncture did not yield important improvements beyond those observed after an initial clinic-based course of acupuncture.|NCT00957112.

23450686	<TITLE>Making ends meet: coordination between RNA 3'-end processing and transcription initiation.</TITLE>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-mediated gene transcription initiates at promoters and ends at terminators. Transcription termination is intimately connected to 3'-end processing of the produced RNA and already when loaded at the promoter, RNAPII starts to become configured for this downstream event. Conversely, RNAPII is 'reset' as part of the 3'-end processing/termination event, thus preparing the enzyme for its next round of transcription--possibly on the same gene. There is both direct and circumstantial evidence for preferential recycling of RNAPII from the gene terminator back to its own promoter, which supposedly increases the efficiency of the transcription process under conditions where RNAPII levels are rate limiting. Here, we review differences and commonalities between initiation and 3'-end processing/termination processes on various types of RNAPII transcribed genes. In doing so, we discuss the requirements for efficient 3'-end processing/termination and how these may relate to proper recycling of RNAPII.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

23586280	<TITLE>A survey of anxiety and depression symptoms among primary-care physicians in China.</TITLE>Anxiety and depression disorder are the most prevalent mental health problems. However, few studies are available pertaining to these problems among Chinese doctors, especially the assessment of the anxiety and depression symptoms among primary-care providers. The aim of this study was to assess the anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese primary-care physicians and their associated factors.|A cross-sectional study was conducted among 451 primary-care physicians in Shanghai China (effective response rate was 79.8%). There were 177 male physicians and 274 female physicians with average age of 37.8 (SD +/- 11.1) years. Questionnaire pertaining to depression disorder was indicated by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and anxiety disorder was indicated by the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS).|The average SAS and SDS standard scores of the primary-care physicians were 41.1 +/- 11.5 and 46.5 +/- 11.8 respectively. Both of the scale scores were higher than those of Chinese national norms (P both < 0.001). SDS standard score > or = 53 and SAS standard score > or = 50 were regarded as screening-positive criteria. SAS and SDS screening positive rates of primary-care physicians were 18.0% and 31.7% respectively. In addition, married/cohabited and divorced/widowed physicians aged over 30 years with educational background of junior college had higher risks of anxiety and depression disorders.|Chinese primary-care physicians were at considerably high risk of anxiety and depression disorders, which was worthy of attention during healthcare system reform in China.

Results were compared to the composite diagnosis according the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. In 34 samples, culture, histology and panfungal PCR were positive in 35%, 38% and 62%, respectively. On the sample level the panfungal PCR revealed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 62.5% compared to proven IFI according postoperative EORTC criteria. On patient level, the sensitivity of the PCR approach was 100%, specificity 62.5%.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23732441	<TITLE>Analysis of an alternative to the H-atom abstraction mechanism in methane C-H bond activation by nonheme iron(IV)-oxo oxidants.</TITLE>The triplet δ-mechanism different from the previously reported ones, i.e., the π-channel with the unoccupied π(xz/yz)* (FeO) orbital and the σ-channel involving the unoccupied α-spin Fe(z2)*-σ orbital, has been theoretically described for the methane hydroxylation by [Fe(IV) = O(TMC)(SR)](+) and its derivative [Fe(IV) = O(TMC)(OH)](+) complex for the first time, and we have undertaken a detailed DFT study on the nature of this state by probing its geometry, electronic property and reactivity in comparison to all other possibilities. DFT calculations indicate that the electron transfer for the (3)δ-channel from the σ(C-H) orbital of the substrate to the final acceptor σ(x2-y2)* orbital of the catalyst occurs through a complex mechanism, which is initiated by the original α-spin electron transfer from the π* orbital of the catalyst to the σ(x2-y2)* orbital, where the α-spin electron from the σ(C-H) orbital of the substrate shifts to the just empty α-spin π* orbital of the catalyst via the O-p(x/y) based π(xz/yz)*-orbital concomitantly. It is also found that the electron-donating ability of the axial ligand could influence the reaction channels, evident by the distinction that the electron-deficient F(-) and CF3CO2(-) ligands react via the (3)σ-channel, whereas the electron-rich SR(-) and OH(-) ligands proceed by the (3)δ-channel. With respect to reactivity, the (3)δ-pathway has a comparable barrier to the (3)π and (5)π-pathways, which may offer a new approach for the specific control of C-H bond activation by the iron(IV)-oxo species.

23748336	<TITLE>Behavior problems in middle childhood: the predictive role of maternal distress, child attachment, and mother-child interactions.</TITLE>The objective of the study was to examine the longitudinal relation between early school-age measures of maternal psychosocial distress, quality of mother-child interactions, and child attachment behavior, and behavior problem profiles in middle childhood using a multi-informant design. Participants were 243 French-speaking mother-child dyads (122 girls) who were part of an ongoing longitudinal project. Maternal psychosocial distress was assessed when children were between 4 and 6 years of age. Mother-child interactive quality and attachment patterns were observed at age 6 during a laboratory visit. At age 8.5, externalizing and internalizing problems were assessed using mother and child reports. Results show that maternal psychosocial distress predicted later social adaptation reported by the child through the mediation of mother-child interactions. Analyses also revealed that higher maternal psychosocial distress and controlling attachment patterns, either of the punitive or caregiving type, significantly predicted membership in both child internalizing and externalizing clinical problem groups. Lower mother-child interactive quality, male gender, and child ambivalent attachment were also predictors of externalizing clinical problems.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23794370	<TITLE>Peptide contour length determines equilibrium secondary structure in protein-analogous micelles.</TITLE>This work advances bottom-up design of bioinspired materials built from peptide-amphiphiles, which are a class of bioconjugates in which a biofunctional peptide is covalently attached to a hydrophobic moiety that drives self-assembly in aqueous solution. Specifically, this work highlights the importance of peptide contour length in determining the equilibrium secondary structure of the peptide as well as the self-assembled (i.e., micelle) geometry. Peptides used here repeat a seven-amino acid sequence between one and four times to vary peptide contour length while maintaining similar peptide-peptide interactions. Without a hydrophobic tail, these peptides all exhibit a combination of random coil and α-helical structure. Upon self-assembly in the crowded environment of a micellar corona, however, short peptides are prone to β-sheet structure and cylindrical micelle geometry while longer peptides remain helical in spheroidal micelles. The transition to β-sheets in short peptides is rapid, whereby amphiphiles first self-assemble with α-helical peptide structure, then transition to their equilibrium β-sheet structure at a rate that depends on both temperature and ionic strength. These results identify peptide contour length as an important control over equilibrium peptide secondary structure and micelle geometry. Furthermore, the time-dependent nature of the helix-to-sheet transition opens the door for shape-changing bioinspired materials with tunable conversion rates.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23806501	<TITLE>Monitoring the clinical outcomes in advanced prostate cancer: what imaging modalities and other markers are reliable?</TITLE>Effective patient care and efficient drug development require accurate tools to assess treatment effects. For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), response biomarkers have historically been poorly reproducible, inaccurate, inconsistently applied, or only loosely associated with tangible clinical benefits such as survival. However, the field of response assessments for prostate cancer is maturing, in compliance with a rigorous process defined by analytic validation, clinical validation, and clinical qualification. For example, bone imaging with technetium-99m scintigraphy has historically been poorly used in prostate cancer clinical trials and routine patient care, and frequently has led to poor decision-making. However, contemporary clinical trial consensus criteria (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2]) have standardized the definition of progression on bone scintigraphy and the clinical trials endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). A validated bone scan interpretation form captures the relevant data elements. rPFS and the forms have been undergoing prospective testing in multiple phase III studies. The first of these trials demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility and correlation with overall survival, and rPFS was used by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of abiraterone in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are another class of assays with significant promise as response-indicator biomarkers. CTC enumeration has undergone analytic validation and has been FDA-cleared for monitoring patients with prostate cancer in conjunction with other clinical methods. It is not yet a surrogate for survival. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are direct indicators of patient benefit. The assays to measure PROs must undergo each of the steps of biomarker development, and are increasingly being standardized and used as clinical trial endpoints. In this review, we critically assess each of these classes of novel biomarkers--imaging, CTC, and PROs--in regard to the quality of data supporting their use to monitor clinical outcomes in advanced prostate cancer.

23852540	<TITLE>Annular erythema and photosensitivity as manifestations of efavirenz-induced cutaneous reactions: a review of five consecutive cases.</TITLE>In HIV-infected persons, a rash is the most common manifestation of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors are a major cause of cutaneous reactions. While the characteristics of nevirapine-associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) have been well described, there are limited data on efavirenz-associated CADRs. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical features of consecutive cases of efavirenz-associated CADRs in a single referral centre diagnosed over a 3 year period.|We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 231 patients admitted with CADRs to a tertiary dermatology ward in Cape Town, South Africa.|In 42/231(18%) cases, there had been exposure to efavirenz in the preceding 8 weeks. Of these, 5/42 (12%) patients were diagnosed with probable efavirenz-associated CADRs based on the Naranjo score. The median exposure to efavirenz before the onset of the rash was 12 days (range 2-48). All the patients were female, with a median age of 31 years and a median CD4 cell count of 300 cells/mm(3) (range 81-887). Four had a photo-distributed eruption and one had a confluent indurated erythema affecting the face, trunk and limbs. In three out of five cases, there were annular plaques with raised erythematous edges and dusky centres, which were photo-distributed. Two patients had a mild transaminitis and another a mild eosinophilia. Histological features were non-specific, with perivascular lymphocytes the only consistent feature. In all five cases, efavirenz was withdrawn and potent topical steroid was the only CADR-specific intervention. The eruptions resolved on discharge from hospital, with no sequelae except for residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.|Photo-distribution and annular erythema should alert clinicians to the possibility of efavirenz-associated CADRs.

In each patient, a mini-implant of a size of 2 × 9 mm was inserted into the anterior palate. Implant stability was assessed using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) immediately after insertion (T0), 2 weeks later (T1), 4 weeks later (T2), and 6 weeks later (T3). Insertion depth (ID) and the maximum insertion torque (IT) were measured. Data were tested for correlations between RFA, ID, and IT. All RFA values were tested for statistically significant differences between the different times.|The mean ID was 7.5 ± 0.6 mm, and the mean IT was 16.8 ± 0.6 Ncm. A correlation was found between RFA and ID (r = .726, P < .0001), whereas no correlations between RFA and IT or between IT and ID were observed. From T0 to T1, the stability (36.1 ± 6.1 implant stability quotient [ISQ]) decreased nonsignificantly by 4.9 ± 6.1 ISQ values (P > .05). Between T1 and T2, the stability decreased highly significantly (P < .001) by 7.9 ± 5.9 ISQ values. From T2 on, RFA remained nearly unchanged (-1.7 ± 3.5 ISQ; P > .05).|Mini-implant stability is subject to changes during the healing process. During weeks 3 and 4, a significant decrease of the stability was observed. After 4 weeks, the stability did not change significantly.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23912050	<TITLE>Reducing the radiation sterilization dose improves mechanical and biological quality while retaining sterility assurance levels of bone allografts.</TITLE>Bone allografts carry a risk of infection, so terminal sterilization by gamma irradiation at 25kGy is recommended; but is deleterious to bone quality. Contemporary bone banking significantly reduces initial allograft bioburden, questioning the need to sterilize at 25kGy.|We inoculated allograft bone with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus pumilus, then exposed them to gamma irradiation at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25kGy. Mechanical and biological properties of allografts were also assessed. Our aim was to determine an optimal dose that achieves sterility assurance while minimizing deleterious effects on allograft tissue.|20-25kGy eliminated both organisms at concentrations from 10(1) to 10(3)CFU, while 10-15kGy sterilized bone samples to a bioburden concentration of 10(2)CFU. Irradiation did not generate pro-inflammatory bone surfaces, as evidenced by macrophage activation, nor did it affect attachment or proliferation of osteoblasts. At doses ≥10kGy, the toughness of cortical bone was reduced (P<0.05), and attachment and fusion of osteoclasts onto irradiated bone declined at 20 and 25kGy (P<0.05). There was no change in collagen cross-links, but a significant dose-response increase in denatured collagen (P<0.05).|Our mechanical and cell biological data converge on 15kGy as a threshold for radiation sterilization of bone allografts. Between 5 and 15kGy, bone banks can undertake validation that provides allografts with an acceptable sterility assurance level, improving their strength and biocompatibility significantly.|The application of radiation sterilization doses between 5 and 15kGy will improve bone allograft mechanical performance and promote integration, while retaining sterility assurance levels. Improved quality of allograft bone will promote superior clinical outcomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Various types of congenital heart diseases are seen in the majority of trisomy 18 patients. Palliative treatment of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis includes options like balloon dilatation, stenting and surgery. Herein, we present a case with trisomy 18 and double outlet right ventricle, pulmonary stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. During the follow-up, at the age of three months, his saturation dropped to 70% and an interventional procedure was planned. The patient was considered high risk, and after discussing treatment options with the family, RVOT stenting was chosen. The patient was lost on the 8th day of the follow-up.

23928436	<TITLE>Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws: a potential alternative to drug holidays.</TITLE>In 2011, the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs released an update by their expert panel on managing the care of patients receiving antiresorptive therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In this report, the panel found no study results that confirmed the effectiveness of drug holidays to prevent antiresorptive agent-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws without increasing the risks of low bone mass. The purpose of this article is to provide suggestions for a pattern of patient care for individuals who desire or require an invasive surgical procedure of the jaws, but who also have a skeleton that is at risk for osteoporotic fracture. The authors reviewed pertinent literature related to basic bone histology, the pharmacokinetics of the aminobisphosphonates (nBP), diagnostic criteria for osteopenia/osteoporosis, and clinical applications of the antiresorptive agents. The skeletal system demonstrates a mixture of resting surfaces (osteocytes, 85%), resorbing surfaces (osteoclasts, 2%), and forming surfaces (osteoblasts, 10%-12%). Deposition of nBP is not uniform, and is highly concentrated in areas of bone remodeling. A full understanding of bone remodeling and the pharmacokinetics of nBP allow for the modification of the antiresorptive therapy and the timing of the oral surgical procedure in a manner that minimizes the prevalence of osteonecrosis while at the same time continuing to protect the patient's skeleton from osteoporotic fracture. The lack of support for drug holidays by the ADA's expert panel is strongly consistent with the science behind bone remodeling and nBP pharmacokinetics. In spite of this, creative interdisciplinary patient care has the potential to dramatically reduce the prevalence of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis (BRON), while at the same time continuing to protect the skeleton of the osteoporotic patient. Creative interdisciplinary patient care may prove to be an effective intervention to reduce the prevalence of BRON of the jaws.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
23964700	<TITLE>To investigate the therapeutic potential of immunochemotherapy with cisplatin + 78 kDa + MPL-A against Leishmania donovani in BALB/c mice.</TITLE>Leishmaniasis has recently garnered attention as one of the diseases 'most neglected' by drug research and development, as the current therapeutic modalities available for the patients are ridden with unacceptable toxicity due to high dosage of the drug, prolonged treatment schedules, resistance and prohibitive costs. A successful chemotherapy requires a restoration of immune response; therefore, we combined Leishmania-specific 78 kDa antigen (with or without adjuvant MPL-A) along with a novel drug cisplatin in infected BALB/c mice and did its comparative analysis with chemotherapy and immunotherapy alone. Animals that were treated with immunochemotherapy showed maximum curative potential as demonstrated by a marked reduction in parasite load. Delayed-type hypersensitivity response to leishmanial antigens has been widely used to assess the level of host protection to the disease. An increased delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was observed in animals given immunotherapy or chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy; however, maximum DTH response was observed in animals treated with cisplatin + 78 kDa + MPL-A. These animals were also found to exhibit higher IgG2a levels greater cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-2) concentrations suggesting the generation of a strong Th1 type of immune response which is responsible for resolution of the disease.

24013009	<TITLE>Cortisol analysis of hair of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).</TITLE>In addition to behavioral evaluations, stress assessments are also important for measuring animal welfare. Assessments of long-term stress are particularly important given that prolonged stress can affect physical health and reproduction. The use of hair cortisol as a marker of long-term stress has been increasing, but there has not yet been any report on the use of such methods with chimpanzees. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish and validate a methodology for analyzing hair cortisol in captive chimpanzees. In the first experiment, hair was removed from the arms of nine chimpanzees living in the Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS) and the regrown hair was sampled 3 months later. Fecal samples were collected periodically during the hair-growth period. The results showed that hair cortisol level was positively correlated with the rate of receiving aggression. Although the correlation between hair and fecal cortisol levels was not significant, the individual with the highest hair cortisol concentration also had the highest fecal cortisol concentration. These results suggest that hair cortisol may reflect long-term stress in chimpanzees. In the second experiment, we investigated the physiological factors affecting hair cortisol concentrations. We cut hair from the arms, sides, and backs of 25 chimpanzees living at the KS and the Primate Research Institute. The results revealed that cortisol varied based on source body part and hair whiteness. Therefore, we recommend that hair should always be collected from the same body part and that white hair should be avoided as much as possible.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24052264	<TITLE>Dragon (repulsive guidance molecule RGMb) inhibits E-cadherin expression and induces apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells.</TITLE>Dragon is one of the three members of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, i.e. RGMa, RGMb (Dragon), and RGMc (hemojuvelin). We previously identified the RGM members as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptors that enhance BMP signaling. Our previous studies found that Dragon is highly expressed in the tubular epithelial cells of mouse kidneys. However, the roles of Dragon in renal epithelial cells are yet to be defined. We now show that overexpression of Dragon increased cell death induced by hypoxia in association with increased cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase-3 levels in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. Dragon also inhibited E-cadherin expression but did not affect epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-β in IMCD3 cells. Previous studies suggest that the three RGM members can function as ligands for the receptor neogenin. Interestingly, our present study demonstrates that the Dragon actions on apoptosis and E-cadherin expression in IMCD3 cells were mediated by the neogenin receptor but not through the BMP pathway. Dragon expression in the kidney was up-regulated by unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice. Compared with wild-type mice, heterozygous Dragon knock-out mice exhibited 45-66% reduction in Dragon mRNA expression, decreased epithelial apoptosis, and increased tubular E-cadherin expression and had attenuated tubular injury after unilateral ureteral obstruction. Our results suggest that Dragon may impair tubular epithelial integrity and induce epithelial apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.	Inhibition of DRAGON ameliorated a kidney injury disease model
24060056	<TITLE>Ameliorative effect of ferulic acid against renal injuries mediated by nuclear factor-kappaB during glycerol-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats.</TITLE>The pathogenesis of glycerol-induced myoglobinuric acute renal failure involves ischemia, vascular congestion and reactive oxygen metabolites. In this study, we have investigated for the first time, the role of ferulic acid in attenuating glycerol-induced nephrotoxicity. Male Wistar rats were injected intramuscularly with 8 mL/kg body weight of 50% glycerol, glycerol + ferulic acid at the dose of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg body weight. After 24 h, the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. Furthermore, determinations of lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as antioxidant enzymes were also analyzed; blood, urine samples were collected in order to quantify renal function and nitric oxide generation, respectively. Glycerol-induced rats showed a significant increase in the level of urinary markers assessed in serum as well as kidney and these were reversed upon ferulic acid treatment. A significant increase in urine nitric oxide, serum as well as kidney LPO, decrease in activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione were observed in glycerol-induced rats. Immunohistochemical study in glycerol-induced rats demonstrated an increase in the level of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). All these effects induced by glycerol were reduced upon treatment with ferulic acid in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, ferulic acid enhances antioxidants and decreases NF-κB, thereby protecting the cells against stress induced by glycerol.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We aimed to estimate the economic burden of cancer in the EU.|In a population-based cost analysis, we evaluated the cost of all cancers and also those associated with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. We obtained country-specific aggregate data for morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use from international and national sources. We estimated health-care costs from expenditure on care in the primary, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient settings, and also drugs. Additionally, we estimated the costs of unpaid care provided by relatives or friends of patients (ie, informal care), lost earnings after premature death, and costs associated with individuals who temporarily or permanently left employment because of illness.|Cancer cost the EU €126 billion in 2009, with health care accounting for €51·0 billion (40%). Across the EU, the health-care costs of cancer were equivalent to €102 per citizen, but varied substantially from €16 per person in Bulgaria to €184 per person in Luxembourg. Productivity losses because of early death cost €42·6 billion and lost working days €9·43 billion. Informal care cost €23·2 billion. Lung cancer had the highest economic cost (€18·8 billion, 15% of overall cancer costs), followed by breast cancer (€15·0 billion, 12%), colorectal cancer (€13·1 billion, 10%), and prostate cancer (€8·43 billion, 7%).|Our results show wide differences between countries, the reasons for which need further investigation.

24214015	<TITLE>Photoresponsive gels prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization.</TITLE>This communication describes photoresponsive gels, prepared using ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), that dissolve upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. Exposure of mixtures of norbornene-type ROMP monomers and new photoreactive cross-linkers comprising two norbornene units bound through a chain containing o-nitrobenzyl esters (NBEs) to well-known ruthenium carbene catalysts gave cross-linked polymer networks that swelled in organic solvents or water depending on the structure of the monomer. These gels became homogeneous upon irradiation with UV light, consistent with breaking of the cross-links through photolysis of the NBE groups. The irradiation time required for homogenization of the gels depended on the cross-link density and the structure of the photoresponsive cross-linker.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The active fraction of CBO (F4) at doses of 100 mg/kg inhibited the diarrhea induced by castor oil (90.1%) or arachidonic acid (72.9%) but did not inhibit the diarrhea induced by PGE2. The active fraction of F4 (FR5) only was tested on diarrhea induced with castor oil and inhibited this diarrhea by 92.1%. The compositions of F4 and FR5 were determined by GC-MS, and oleic, palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids were found. F4 and a mixture of the four fatty acids inhibited diarrhea at doses of 100 mg/kg (90.1% and 70.6%, resp.). The results of this study show that B. odorata has antidiarrheal effects, as is claimed by folk medicine, and could possibly be used for the production of a phytomedicine.

24309193	<TITLE>Regioselective dehydrogenation of 3-keto-steroids to form conjugated enones using o-iodoxybenzoic acid and trifluoroacetic acid catalysis.</TITLE>Mild and regioselective conversion of 3-keto-5α- and 3-keto-5β-steroids (trans A/B- and cis A/B-ring juncture, respectively) to the corresponding enones (Δ(1)- and Δ(4)-3-ketones) by treatment with o-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DMSO, is described. The IBX-mediated reaction involved dehydrogenation of the α- and β-hydrogen atoms of the 3-ketones to give the enones regioselectively in good isolated yields without concomitant formation of related dienones and trienones.

24352778	<TITLE>Effect and possible mechanism of muscle-splitting approach on multifidus muscle injury and atrophy after posterior lumbar spine surgery.</TITLE>Multifidus muscle injury and atrophy are common after posterior lumbar spine surgery and are associated with low back pain and functional disability. In theory, muscle-splitting and retraction with a self-retaining retractor are considered to be the major surgical factors. The effects and mechanisms of retraction have been well studied, but the exact effect and possible mechanism of injury and atrophy after muscle-splitting still lack experimental evidence.|New Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups. In group S, through a skin and lumbodorsal fascial incision, the bilateral multifidus muscles were dissected from the osseous structures in the standard fashion, while in group C, only a skin and lumbodorsal fascial incision was made. In each group, the multifidus muscle was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and by histological analysis at three and forty-eight hours and at one, three, six, twelve, and twenty-four weeks after surgery.|In group C, there was no injury or atrophy of the multifidus muscle after surgery. In group S, the mean T2-weighted signal intensity ratios of gross multifidus to psoas on fat-suppressed T2-weighted cross-sectional MRI scans peaked on week 3 and returned to baseline on week 24. Necrosis and inflammation of the multifidus muscle were evident and became more severe at one week. Fibrotic change was mainly seen at three and six weeks after surgery, and fatty degeneration mainly occurred at twelve and twenty-four weeks. Decreased acetylcholine activity and granular degeneration of the neuromuscular junction were observed at all follow-up times, and the numbers of degenerating neuromuscular junctions increased significantly with time after surgery.|The splitting approach is an important cause of multifidus muscle injury and atrophy in posterior lumbar spine surgery. Denervation and disuse may be important factors in multifidus muscle atrophy in the splitting approach.|This study provides a basis for the prevention of multifidus muscle injury and atrophy after posterior lumbar surgery.

24397228	<TITLE>Parking: an effective strategy described.</TITLE>A hospital car park needs to balance the demands of patients, visitors, and staff, without, for example, compromising emergency vehicles' access to the Accident & Emergency Department. However, with car ownership on the rise, the half a million car parking spaces across all Trust sites in England may not be enough to meet future demand. Philip Herring, managing director of VINCI Park UK, which designs, finances, builds, and operates, car parks for a variety of sectors, argues that having in place an effective strategy for future parking is vital to meet the growing needs of patients, visitors, and staff, as well as budgetary and environmental commitments.

24400962	<TITLE>Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria is rare cause for thrombosis of the intra-abdominal veins in the ethnic Indian population - results from FLAER-based flowcytometry screening.</TITLE>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) may present as cytopenia, hemolysis, or thrombosis at unusual sites including splanchnic vessels. Thrombosis of the portal veins and hepatic veins are associated with thrombophilic risk factors: deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin, positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies, and factor V Leiden mutation. There is limited information regarding PNH presenting primarily as a thrombotic event. We prospectively screened 142 consecutive patients with intrabdominal thrombosis and 106 controls with fluorescently labeled inactive toxin aerolysin (FLAER)-based flowcytometry to assess the frequency of PNH as a thrombophilic risk factor in patients with intra-abdominal thrombosis.|Granulocytes of patients and controls were screened with CD 24 and FLAER and monocytes with CD 14 and FLAER. Dual negativity of >1% events in both lineages was interpreted as a positive PNH clone. Screening for thrombophilia risk factors was carried out.|Two (1.4%) cases had large PNH clones. RBC also demonstrated the PNH defect. Thrombophilia risk factors were as follows: deficiency of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin in 13.4%, 4.9%, and 2.1%, respectively, and positivity for anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant in 9.2%, 1.4%, and 0.7%, respectively. Factor V Leiden mutation was seen in 1.4% patients.|PNH was uncommon in patients with intra-abdominal thrombosis in the ethnic Indian population. Despite low positivity, screening by flowcytometry for PNH is of value in this group of patients because it provides an opportunity to rapidly establish the diagnosis of this treatable disorder, which might otherwise be missed if the initial presentation is only thrombotic.

24412575	<TITLE>Basal cell signaling by p63 controls luminal progenitor function and lactation via NRG1.</TITLE>The mammary epithelium is organized as a bilayer of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cells. During pregnancy, the luminal compartment expands for milk production, while basal cells are thought to provide structural and contractile support. Here, we reveal a pregnancy-specific role of basal epithelia as a central coordinator of lactogenesis. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of the transcription factor p63 (Trp63) gene exclusively within basal cells of the adult gland during pregnancy leads to dramatic defects in luminal cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in lactation failure. This phenotype is explained by direct transcriptional activation of the epidermal growth factor family ligand gene Nrg1 by p63 selectively in basal cells, which is required for luminal ERBB4/STAT5A activation and consequent luminal progenitor cell maturation. Thus, paracrine basal-to-luminal cell signaling, controlled by p63 via NRG1, orchestrates the entire lactation program. Collectively, these findings redefine the paradigm for cellular interactions specifying the functional maturation of the mammary gland.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24426320	<TITLE>Bovine papillomavirus E2 and E5 gene expression in sperm cells of healthy bulls.</TITLE>Papillomaviruses are found in epithelial lesions and are linked to different carcinogenic processes in humans and other animals. Although BPV has been characterized as epitheliotropic, the presence of viral DNA has been detected in other tissues and fluids, such as fresh semen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and expression of BPV in sperm cells of bulls (Bos taurus) asymptomatic for papillomatosis. A PCR assay was carried out with specific primers to test BPV2 in 26 semen samples. The presence of BPV transcripts was assessed by RT-PCR to E2 and E5 genes. BPV2 DNA was detected in nine out of 26 samples and the expression of E2 and E5 were detected in five out of nine BPV positive samples. This is the first record of BPV2 expression in bull sperm cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24455679	<TITLE>Protective effects of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 against hippocampal apoptosis and spatial learning and memory deficits in a rat model of vascular dementia.</TITLE>Vascular dementia (VaD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease resulting from chronic hypoxia. In the present study, we examined the protective effects of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 against hippocampal apoptosis and spatial learning and memory deficits in a chronic hypoperfusion rat model of VaD established by permanent bilateral carotid occlusion (2-VO). Sixty rats were randomly divided into sham-operated, VaD model, and VaD plus SB202190 groups (n = 20/group). After sham/2-VO surgery, rats were administered 0.1% DMSO (sham-operated and VaD groups) or SB202190 by intracerebroventricular injection. One week after inhibitor/vehicle treatment, hippocampal p38 MAPK phosphorylation was higher in the model group than in the SB202190 group (P < 0.01). Compared to the model group, the SB202190 group exhibited significantly shorter escape latencies in the Morris water maze hidden platform trials (P < 0.01) and longer times in the original platform quadrant during probe trials (P < 0.01). The SB202190 group also showed significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus compared to VaD model rats (P < 0.01) as well as higher (antiapoptotic) Bcl-2 expression and lower (proapoptotic) caspase-3 expression (P < 0.01 for both). In conclusion, blockade of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by SB202190 following permanent 2-OV reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and rescued spatial learning and memory deficits.	Inhibition of P38 MAPK ameliorated a dementia disease model
24472705	<TITLE>Study of Patient Information after percutaneous Coronary Intervention (SPICI): should prevention programmes become more effective?</TITLE>This cross-sectional observational study was designed to evaluate the uptake and outcome of patient education after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).|A questionnaire containing 41 items was handed out to consecutive patients from randomly selected Swedish hospitals after PCI. Questions concerned the patient's attribution of the cause of the cardiac event, perception of the information provided by physicians and nurses, and a self-assessment of changes in lifestyle post PCI regarding tobacco, physical activity, food habits and stress. Replies were obtained from 1,073 patients (reply rate 67%). Non-modifiable risk factors (age, heredity) were attributed a higher rate as the cause of disease compared to modifiable factors (smoking, physical activity, food habits). Most patients (67%) perceived they were cured, and 38% perceived from the given information that there was no need to change their habits. A mere 27% reported that they still had cardiovascular disease and needed behavioural change. After PCI, 16% continued to use tobacco; half of these were offered smoking cessation support. In spite of an 80% referral rate to cardiac rehabilitation, one out of two patients did not enrol. Fewer than half were regularly physically active. Nutritional counselling was provided to 71%, but only 40% changed food habits. Stress management programmes were rarely provided.|Current preventive practice scarcely meets the challenge posed by the progress in modern invasive cardiology. The Study of Patient Information after percutaneous Coronary Intervention (SPICI) motivates an in-depth revision and adaptation of cardiac rehabilitation programmes in order to improve patient understanding of the disease, and to support greater compliance with a cardioprotective lifestyle.

The questionnaire covered oral hygiene regimen, adverse oral habits, information regarding dental visits and dental treatment.|Results showed less than adequate oral hygiene practices among both the groups with more so in the graduate group (P ≤ 0.05). Very few dentists in both the groups reported any adverse oral habit. A more positive (P ≤ 0.05) attitude towards regular dental check up and dental treatment was seen in post-graduate dentists when compared to graduates.|Very few dentists in both the groups followed ideal dental hygiene regimen. Dentists are the role models for the society as far as oral health is concerned; hence they need to be more responsible and lay more stress on their daily regimen and improve the scenario.

24494191	<TITLE>The role of Nox1 and Nox2 in GPVI-dependent platelet activation and thrombus formation.</TITLE>Activation of the platelet-specific collagen receptor, glycoprotein (GP) VI, induces intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; however the relevance of ROS to GPVI-mediated platelet responses remains unclear.|The objective of this study was to explore the role of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase (Nox)1 and 2 complexes in GPVI-dependent platelet activation and collagen-induced thrombus formation.|ROS production was measured by quantitating changes in the oxidation-sensitive dye, H2DCF-DA, following platelet activation with the GPVI-specific agonist, collagen related peptide (CRP). Using a pharmacological inhibitor specific for Nox1, 2-acetylphenothiazine (ML171), and Nox2 deficient mice, we show that Nox1 is the key Nox homolog regulating GPVI-dependent ROS production. Nox1, but not Nox2, was essential for CRP-dependent thromboxane (Tx)A2 production, which was mediated in part through p38 MAPK signaling; while neither Nox1 nor Nox2 was significantly involved in regulating CRP-induced platelet aggregation/integrin αIIbβ3 activation, platelet spreading, or dense granule and α-granule release (ATP release and P-selectin surface expression, respectively). Ex-vivo perfusion analysis of mouse whole blood revealed that both Nox1 and Nox2 were involved in collagen-mediated thrombus formation at arterial shear.|Together these results demonstrate a novel role for Nox1 in regulating GPVI-induced ROS production, which is essential for optimal p38 activation and subsequent TxA2 production, providing an explanation for reduced thrombus formation following Nox1 inhibition.

24501572	<TITLE>A multi-station proprioceptive exercise program in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthrosis: functional capacity, pain and sensoriomotor function. A randomized controlled trial.</TITLE>We investigated the effects of a multi-station proprioceptive exercise program on functional capacity, perceived knee pain, and sensoriomotor function. Twenty-two patients (aged 41-75 years) with grade 2-3 bilateral knee osteoarthrosis were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment (TR; n = 12) and non-treatment (NONTR; n = 10). TR performed 11 different balance/coordination and proprioception exercises, twice a week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity and perceived knee pain during rest and physical activity was measured. Also knee position sense, kinaesthesia, postural control, isometric and isokinetic knee strength (at 60, 120 and 180°·s(-1)) measures were taken at baseline and after 6 weeks of training. There was no significant difference in any of the tested variables between TR and NONTR before the intervention period. In TR perceived knee pain during daily activities and functional tests was lessened following the exercise program (p < 0.05). Perceived knee pain was also lower in TR vs. NONTR after training (p < 0.05). The time for rising from a chair, stair climbing and descending improved in TR (p < 0.05) and these values were faster compared with NONTR after training (p < 0.05). Joint position sense (degrees) for active and passive tests and for weight bearing tests improved in TR (p < 0.05) and the values were lower compared with NONTR after training (p < 0.05). Postural control ('eyes closed') also improved for single leg and tandem tests in TR (p < 0.01) and these values were higher compared with NONTR after training. The isometric quadriceps strength of TR improved (p < 0.05) but the values were not significantly different compared with NONTR after training. There was no change in isokinetic strength for TR and NONTR after the training period. The results suggest that using a multi-station proprioceptive exercise program it is possible to improve postural control, functional capacity and decrease perceived knee pain in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthrosis. Key PointsIt is possible to improve postural control, functional capacity and decrease perceived knee pain in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthrosis with a pure proprioceptive/ balance exercise program used in the present study.The exercise regime used in the present study was as effective as previous studies, but of much shorter duration and utilized unsophisticated, inexpensive equipment which is available in most physiotherapy departments.Therefore, the incorporation of this exercise program into clinical practice is readily feasible.

24507552	<TITLE>Anaemia secondary to critical illness: an unexplained phenomenon.</TITLE>Almost all patients suffering critical illness become anaemic during their time in intensive care. The cause of this anaemia and its management has been a topic of debate in critical care medicine for the last two decades. Packed red cell transfusion has an associated cost and morbidity such that decreasing the number of units transfused would be of great benefit. Our understanding of the aetiology and importance of this anaemia is improving with recent and ongoing work to establish the cause, effect and best treatment options. This review aims to describe the current literature whilst suggesting that the nature of the anaemia should be considered with reference to the time point in critical illness. Finally, we suggest that using haemoglobin concentration as a measure of oxygen-carrying capacity has limitations and that ways of measuring haemoglobin mass should be explored.

24525273	<TITLE>Geospatial analysis of hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems pain management experience scores in U.S. hospitals.</TITLE>Although prior work has investigated the interplay between demographic and intrasurvey correlations of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores, these prior studies have not included geospatial analyses, or analyses that take into account location effects. Here, we report the results of a geospatial analysis (not equivalent to simple geographical analysis) of patient experience scores pertaining to pain. HCAHPS data collected in 2011 were examined to test the hypothesis that HCAHPS patient experience with pain management (PEPM) scores were geospatially distributed throughout the United States using Moran's Index, which measures the association between PEPM scores and hospital location. After limiting the dataset to hospitals in the continental United States with nonzero HCAHPS response rates, 3645 hospitals were included in the analyses. "Always" responses were geospatially clustered amongst the analyzed hospitals. Clustering was significant in all distances tested from 10 to 5000km (P<0.0001). We identified 6 demarcated groups of hospitals. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a regional geographic effect on PEPM scores. These results may carry policy implications for U.S. hospitals with regard to acute pain outcomes. Further analyses will be necessary to evaluate policy explanations and implications of the regional geographic differences in PEPM results.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24526195	<TITLE>Pulmonary hypertension in a pregnant patient with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease: considerations with respect to treatment.</TITLE>A 13 weeks pregnant 24-year-old patient with a history of Graves' disease presented with progressive dyspnoea existing for 4-6 weeks. Blood tests showed severe thyrotoxicosis and transthoracic echocardiography suggested severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) which was thought to be secondary to thyrotoxicosis. PH secondary to thyrotoxicosis is often reversible and may occur 3-14 months after normalisation of free T4 and T3 levels. The maternal mortality risk of PH in pregnancy is high despite modern treatment strategies (17-33%). In this case, PH was carefully monitored for 1 month. No changes in pulmonary artery pressure were found despite immediate treatment with propylthiouracil and β-blockade. We anticipated that the normalisation of pulmonary artery pressure would not occur during this pregnancy and that the risk of complications would remain high. In the interest of the mother an abortion was suggested. Termination of pregnancy took place at the gestational age of 16 weeks.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We sought to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of the periprocedural administration of tirofiban in a largest Serbian PPCI centre.|We analysed 2995 consecutive PPCI patients enrolled in the Clinical Center of Serbia STEMI Register, between February 2007 and March 2012. All patients were pretreated with 600 mg clopidogrel and 300 mg aspirin. Major adverse cardiovascular events, comprising all-cause death, nonfatal infarction, nonfatal stroke, and ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularization, was the primary efficacy end point. TIMI major bleeding was the key safety end point.|Analyses drawn from the propensity-matched sample showed improved primary efficacy end point in the tirofiban group at 30-day (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.97) and at 1-year (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96) follow up. Moreover, tirofiban group had a significantly lower 30-day all-cause mortality (secondary end point; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.90), compared with patients who were not administered tirofiban. At 1 year, a trend towards a lower all-cause mortality was observed in the tirofiban group (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-1.04). No differences were found with respect to the TIMI major bleeding during the follow-up period.|Tirofiban administered with PPCI, following 600 mg clopidogrel pretreatment, improved primary efficacy outcome at 30 days and at 1 year follow up without an increase in major bleeding.

24582445	<TITLE>Relationships between dry matter content, ensiling, ammonia-nitrogen, and ruminal in vitro starch digestibility in high-moisture corn samples.</TITLE>The objectives of the study were (1) to determine relationships between high-moisture corn (HMC) dry matter (DM), ammonia-N [% of crude protein (CP)], and soluble CP concentrations, and pH, with 7-h ruminal in vitro starch digestibility (ivStarchD), and (2) to evaluate the effect of ensiling on pH, ammonia-N, soluble CP, and ivStarchD measurements in HMC. A data set comprising 6,131 HMC samples (55 to 80% DM) obtained from a commercial feed analysis laboratory was used for this study. Month of sample submittal was assumed to be associated with length of the ensiling period. Data for month of sample submittal were analyzed using Proc Mixed in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with month as a fixed effect. Regressions to determine linear and quadratic relationships between ivStarchD and ammonia-N, soluble CP, pH, and DM content were performed using Proc Mixed. The ivStarchD increased by 9 percentage units from October to August of the following year. Similar results were observed for ammonia-N and soluble CP with increases from 1.8 to 4.6% of CP and 31.3 to 46.4% of CP, respectively, from October to August of the following year. Ammonia-N was positively related to ivStarchD (R(2)=0.61). The DM content of HMC at silo removal was negatively related (R(2)=0.47) to ivStarchD with a decrease of 1.6 percentage units in ivStarchD per 1-percentage-unit increase in DM content. The pH of HMC was negatively related to ammonia-N (R(2)=0.53), soluble CP (R(2)=0.57), and ivStarchD (R(2)=0.51). Combined, ammonia-N, DM, soluble CP, and pH provided a good prediction of ivStarchD (adjusted R(2)=0.70). Increasing pH, ammonia-N, soluble CP, and ivStarchD values indicate that HMC may need up to 10 mo of ensiling to reach maximum starch digestibility. Ammonia-N, DM content, soluble CP concentration, and pH are good indicators of ruminal in vitro starch digestibility for high-moisture corn.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24587269	<TITLE>Pronounced fixation, strong population differentiation and complex population history in the Canary Islands blue tit subspecies complex.</TITLE>Evolutionary molecular studies of island radiations may lead to insights in the role of vicariance, founder events, population size and drift in the processes of population differentiation. We evaluate the degree of population genetic differentiation and fixation of the Canary Islands blue tit subspecies complex using microsatellite markers and aim to get insights in the population history using coalescence based methods. The Canary Island populations were strongly genetically differentiated and had reduced diversity with pronounced fixation including many private alleles. In population structure models, the relationship between the central island populations (La Gomera, Tenerife and Gran Canaria) and El Hierro was difficult to disentangle whereas the two European populations showed consistent clustering, the two eastern islands (Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) and Morocco weak clustering, and La Palma a consistent unique lineage. Coalescence based models suggested that the European mainland forms an outgroup to the Afrocanarian population, a split between the western island group (La Palma and El Hierro) and the central island group, and recent splits between the three central islands, and between the two eastern islands and Morocco, respectively. It is clear that strong genetic drift and low level of concurrent gene flow among populations have shaped complex allelic patterns of fixation and skewed frequencies over the archipelago. However, understanding the population history remains challenging; in particular, the pattern of extreme divergence with low genetic diversity and yet unique genetic material in the Canary Island system requires an explanation. A potential scenario is population contractions of a historically large and genetically variable Afrocanarian population, with vicariance and drift following in the wake. The suggestion from sequence-based analyses of a Pleistocene extinction of a substantial part of North Africa and a Pleistocene/Holocene eastward re-colonisation of western North Africa from the Canaries remains possible.

24605081	<TITLE>Molecular Characterization of Neurally Differentiated Human Bone Marrow-derived Clonal Mesenchymal Stem Cells.</TITLE>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, with the ability to differentiate into different cell types. Additionally, the immunomodulatory activity of MSCs can downregulate inflammatory responses. The use of MSCs to repair injured tissues and treat inflammation, including in neuroimmune diseases, has been extensively explored. Although MSCs have emerged as a promising resource for the treatment of neuroimmune diseases, attempts to define the molecular properties of MSCs have been limited by the heterogeneity of MSC populations. We recently developed a new method, the subfractionation culturing method, to isolate homogeneous human clonal MSCs (hcMSCs). The hcMSCs were able to differentiate into fat, cartilage, bone, neuroglia, and liver cell types. In this study, to better understand the properties of neurally differentiated MSCs, gene expression in highly homogeneous hcMSCs was analyzed. Neural differentiation of hcMSCs was induced for 14 days. Thereafter, RNA and genomic DNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis and DNA methylation array analysis, respectively. We correlated the transcriptome of hcMSCs during neural differentiation with the DNA methylation status. Here, we describe and discuss the gene expression profile of neurally differentiated hcMSCs. These findings will expand our understanding of the molecular properties of MSCs and contribute to the development of cell therapy for neuroimmune diseases.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24612609	<TITLE>TIM4 Regulates the Anti-Islet Th2 Alloimmune Response.</TITLE>The role of the novel costimulatory molecule TIM4 in anti-islet response is unknown. We explored TIM4 expression and targeting in Th1 (BALB/c islets into C57BL/6 mice) and Th2 (BALB/c islets into Tbet(-/-) C57BL/6 mice) models of anti-islet alloimmune response and in a model of anti-islet autoimmune response (diabetes onset in NOD mice). The targeting of TIM4, using the monoclonal antibody RMT4-53, promotes islet graft survival in a Th1 model, with 30% of the graft surviving in the long term; islet graft protection appears to be mediated by a Th1 to Th2 skewing of the immune response. Differently, in the Th2 model, TIM4 targeting precipitates graft rejection by further enhancing the Th2 response. The effect of anti-TIM4 treatment in preventing autoimmune diabetes was marginal with only minor Th1 to Th2 skewing. B-Cell depletion abolished the effect of TIM4 targeting. TIM4 is expressed on human B-cells and is upregulated in diabetic and islet-transplanted patients. Our data suggest a model in which TIM4 targeting promotes Th2 response over Th1 via B-cells. The targeting of TIM4 could become a component of an immunoregulatory protocol in clinical islet transplantation, aiming at redirecting the immune system toward a Th2 response.

24620704	<TITLE>An assistive device for direction estimation of a sound source.</TITLE>A wearable assistive device is proposed that visually indicates the direction of a sound source for people who cannot hear but can see when a loud sound occurs. The device has been implemented in the shape of common eyeglasses, so that it does not draw attention to the wearer's hearing impairment. Acoustical information is acquired by an array of microelectromechanical-system microphones attached to the eyeglasses. The direction of a sound source is estimated in real time and indicated to the user via four light-emitting diodes designating the front, back, left, and right directions. Two methods for estimating the sound direction were compared: delay-and-sum beamformer and sound pressure level (SPL) comparison. The performance of the directional estimation was evaluated using the head-and-torso simulator. The SPL comparison method was 92% accurate versus the 84% accuracy of the delay-and-sum beamformer approach.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24640925	<TITLE>Testicular biopsy in psittacine birds (Psittaciformes): comparative evaluation of testicular reproductive status by endoscopic, histologic, and cytologic examination.</TITLE>Knowledge of the reproductive cycle of male parrots is important for examining the male genital tract and for successful breeding, especially of endangered species. To evaluate different diagnostic methods and criteria concerning the classification of reproductive stages, we examined 20 testicular samples obtained at necropsy in psittacine birds of different species and testicular biopsy samples collected from 9 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) and 7 rose-ringed parakeets (Psittacula krameri) by endoscopy 4 times over a 12-month period. The testicular reproductive status was assessed histologically and then compared with the macroscopic appearance of the testicles and cytologic results. The histologic examination was nondiagnostic in 19 of 59 testicular biopsy samples. By contrast, the cytologic preparations were diagnostic in 57 of 59 biopsy samples. The results of the cytologic examination coincided with the histologic results in 34 of 38 biopsy samples and 18 of 20 necropsy samples. Macroscopic parameters displayed some differences between reproductive stages but provided an unreliable indication of the reproductive status. These results suggest that microscopic examination of a testicular biopsy sample is a reliable method for evaluating the reproductive status of male parrots and is preferable to the macroscopic evaluation of the testicle. Cytologic examination provides fast preliminary results, even when the histologic preparation is not sufficient for evaluation, but results may be erroneous. Thus, a combination of histologic and cytologic examination is recommended for evaluating testicular reproductive status.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Using a hydrodynamic free-energy model, we show that the temporal evolution of the nanobubble radius is asymmetrical: the expansion is found to be adiabatic, while the collapse is best described by an isothermal evolution. We unveil the critical role of the thermal boundary resistance in the kinetics of formation of the nanobubbles: close to the vapor production threshold, nanobubble generation is very long, yielding optimal conditions for laser-energy conversion. Furthermore, the long appearance times allow nanoparticle melting before the onset of vaporization.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24684672	<TITLE>Rheumatoid arthritis and the biological clock.</TITLE>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause and a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder ensuing in genetically predisposed subjects, characterized by synovitis causing joint destruction, as well as inflammation in body organ systems, leading to anatomical alteration and functional disability. Immune competent cells, deregulated synoviocytes and cytokines play a key role in the pathophysiological mechanisms. The immune system function shows time-related variations related to the influence of the neuroendocrine system and driven by the circadian clock circuitry. Immune processes and symptom intensity in RA are characterized by oscillations during the day following a pattern of circadian rhythmicity. A cross-talk between inflammatory and circadian pathways is involved in RA pathogenesis and underlies the mutual actions of disruption of the circadian clock circuitry on immune system function as well as of inflammation on the function of the biological clock. Modulation of molecular processes and humoral factors mediating in RA the interplay between the biological clock and the immune response and underlying the rhythmic fluctuations of pathogenic processes and symptomatology could represent a promising therapeutic strategy in the future.

24758478	<TITLE>Coffee rings as low-resource diagnostics: detection of the malaria biomarker Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-II using a surface-coupled ring of Ni(II)NTA gold-plated polystyrene particles.</TITLE>We report a novel, low-resource malaria diagnostic platform inspired by the coffee ring phenomenon, selective for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-II (PfHRP-II), a biomarker indicative of the P. falciparum parasite strain. In this diagnostic design, a recombinant HRP-II (rcHRP-II) biomarker is sandwiched between 1 μm Ni(II)nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) gold-plated polystyrene microspheres (AuPS) and Ni(II)NTA-functionalized glass. After rcHRP-II malaria biomarkers had reacted with Ni(II)NTA-functionalized particles, a 1 μL volume of the particle-protein conjugate solution is deposited onto a functionalized glass slide. Drop evaporation produces the radial flow characteristic of coffee ring formation, and particle-protein conjugates are transported toward the drop edge, where, in the presence of rcHRP-II, particles bind to the Ni(II)NTA-functionalized glass surface. After evaporation, a wash with deionized water removes nonspecifically bound materials while maintaining the integrity of the surface-coupled ring produced by the presence of the protein biomarker. The dynamic range of this design was found to span 3 orders of magnitude, and rings are visible with the naked eye at protein concentrations as low as 10 pM, 1 order of magnitude below the 100 pM PfHRP-II threshold recommended by the World Health Organization. Key enabling features of this design are the inert and robust gold nanoshell to reduce nonspecific interactions on the particle surface, inclusion of a water wash step after drop evaporation to reduce nonspecific binding to the glass, a large diameter particle to project a large two-dimensional viewable area after ring formation, and a low particle density to favor radial flow toward the drop edge and reduce vertical settling to the glass surface in the center of the drop. This robust, antibody-free assay offers a simple user interface and clinically relevant limits of biomarker detection, two critical features required for low-resource malaria detection.

24846958	<TITLE>A Bayesian clustering approach for detecting gene-gene interactions in high-dimensional genotype data.</TITLE>This paper uses a Bayesian formulation of a clustering procedure to identify gene-gene interactions under case-control studies, called the Algorithm via Bayesian Clustering to Detect Epistasis (ABCDE). The ABCDE uses Dirichlet process mixtures to model SNP marker partitions, and uses the Gibbs weighted Chinese restaurant sampling to simulate posterior distributions of these partitions. Unlike the representative Bayesian epistasis detection algorithm BEAM, which partitions markers into three groups, the ABCDE can be evaluated at any given partition, regardless of the number of groups. This study also develops permutation tests to validate the disease association for SNP subsets identified by the ABCDE, which can yield results that are more robust to model specification and prior assumptions. This study examines the performance of the ABCDE and compares it with the BEAM using various simulated data and a schizophrenia SNP dataset.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
24910415	<TITLE>Different cellular responses of dexmedetomidine at infected site and peripheral blood of emdotoxemic BALB/c mice.</TITLE>Various sedative agents, including dexmedetomidine (dex), induce immunosuppression, and enhance infection progression. However, there was no information on how anesthetic affects local and systemic cellular immune function. We conducted this study to examine the impact of dex on the differentiation and function of immune cells at site of inflammation and in peripheral blood during endotoxemia of mice. In BALB/c mice with and without endotoxemia, we evaluated the influence of two dosages of 5 and 50 mcg/kg/h intravenous dex on immune cells: including number of T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), natural killer cells (CD8a), monocytes (CD11b), and macrophages (Mac-3) in peripheral blood, the activities of macrophages in peripheral blood and in peritoneal lavage, and proliferation of B and T cells and of natural killer cells activity in the spleen. Endotoxemia increased the number of CD3 T cells, CD 19 B cells and macrophages in the peripheral blood, augmented macrophage activity in the peritoneum, and increased T cell proliferation and natural killer cell activity in the spleen. Further administration of 5 mcg/kg/h dex attenuated systemic increase in number of T cells, B cells, and macrophages during endotoxemia and 50 mcg/kg/h dex significantly attenuated the increase in activity of macrophages in the peripheral blood during endotoxemia. In the peritoneum, however, 5 mcg/kg/h dex preserved and 50 mcg/kg/h dexmedetomidine enhanced the activity of macrophages during endotoxemia. Increased in proliferation of T cells in spleen during endotoxemia was attenuated by both doses of dex. Last, 50 mcg/kg/h dex enhanced natural killer cells activity during endotoxemia. While preserving the effects of endotoxemia on macrophage's activity in the infection site and natural killer cell's activity in the spleen, dex decreased systemic fulminant immune reaction in endotoxemia, by attenuating the augmented response in the number of T cells, B cells and macrophages, activity of macrophages in the peripheral blood, and proliferation of T cells in spleen during endotoxemia.

24965776	<TITLE>The Eμ enhancer region influences H chain expression and B cell fate without impacting IgVH repertoire and immune response in vivo.</TITLE>The IgH intronic enhancer region Eμ is a combination of both a 220-bp core enhancer element and two 310-350-bp flanking scaffold/matrix attachment regions named MARsEμ. In the mouse, deletion of the core-enhancer Eμ element mainly affects VDJ recombination with minor effects on class switch recombination. We carried out endogenous deletion of the full-length Eμ region (core plus MARsEμ) in the mouse genome to study VH gene repertoire and IgH expression in developing B-lineage cells. Despite a severe defect in VDJ recombination with partial blockade at the pro-B cell stage, Eμ deletion (core or full length) did not affect VH gene usage. Deletion of this regulatory region induced both a decrease of pre-B cell and newly formed B cell compartments and a strong orientation toward the marginal zone B cell subset. Because Igμ H chain expression was decreased in Eμ-deficient pre-B cells, we propose that modification of B cell homeostasis in deficient animals was caused by "weak" pre-B cell and BCR expression. Besides imbalances in B cell compartments, Ag-specific Ab responses were not impaired in animals carrying the Eμ deletion. In addition to its role in VDJ recombination, our study points out that the full-length Eμ region does not influence VH segment usage but ensures efficient Igμ-chain expression required for strong signaling through pre-B cells and newly formed BCRs and thus participates in B cell inflow and fate.

25007972	<TITLE>Laparoscopic treatment of incisional and primary ventral hernia in morbidly obese patients with a BMI over 35.</TITLE>Incisional and ventral hernias are common surgical indications. Their management is associated with significant complications and recurrences in open surgery (15-25%). Since laparoscopy has become a standard in bariatric surgery, there has been a natural trend to treat obese patients with parietal wall defects laparoscopically. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the results of the laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects in patients with a BMI >35.|A series of 79 patients were included. Data were acquired prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The surgical procedure was standardized: 3 ports, mesh type (Parietex™ Composite mesh, Covidien, France), fixation with non-absorbable transfascial sutures, and tackers. Complications were evaluated.|Out of 79 patients (29 men, 50 women), 43 had umbilical and 36 had ventral hernias. Mean age was 52.4 years, and mean BMI was 40.83 kg/m(2). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. Postoperative pain evaluated by visual analog scale was 2.86. No intraoperative complications or deaths occurred. Seven postoperative complications occurred (8.86%): two parietal wall hematomas treated by radiological embolization, two significant cases of postoperative pain, one postoperative obstruction, one spontaneously resolved respiratory failure, and one early (day 1) parietal wall defect with immediate reoperation. Postoperative seroma rate was 26.58% (21 patients, all of whom were treated conservatively). Postoperative follow-up was 18.10 months (1-84 months), and recurrence rate was 3.8% (3 patients).|This study confirms the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach for ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients. Recurrence rates (3.8%) appeared lower than the ones observed in the literature (15-25%). Postoperative hemorrhage and port-site hernia are specific complications of this approach. Postoperative hospital stay is low (2 days) as compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects should be considered a standard option in morbidly obese patients.

25056190	<TITLE>The effect of the type of pain on the accuracy of memory of pain and affect.</TITLE>Memory of chronic, acute and experimental pain may be inaccurate, but the research findings are inconsistent. The main aim of the study was to compare the memory of three types of pain and their associated affect.|A total of 140 women, who gave birth by vaginal delivery or Caesarean section, or underwent gynaecological surgery, participated in the study. Before childbirth or surgery, the women rated their anxiety about the pain they would experience. Between 24 and 48 h after childbirth or surgery, they rated the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain, and their positive and negative affect. Either 3 or 6 months later, the participants recalled the pain and affect they had felt.|The study found that the type of pain had an effect on memory of pain and affect. Surgery led to an overestimation of all but one of the recalled variables. Participants who gave birth by Caesarean section were the most accurate at recalling pain and affect. Memories of pain and affect were most variable in participants who gave birth by vaginal delivery. The three groups of participants differed in terms of the predictors of recalled pain intensity and unpleasantness, and the proportion of variance predicted by the same independent variables.|The results of the current study suggest that memory of pain and affect is influenced by the meaning and affective value of the pain experience. This may help us to understand why the previous research on the memory of pain were so diverse.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Key aspects of the functional mental health literacy that has been examined include recognition of mental disorders, knowledge about causation, and treatment preferences. The modes of seeking mental health information are yet to be examined. Some studies utilized a methodology that allowed for respondents to use local labels to describe their understanding of various mental disorders. Otherwise, respondents were largely unable to label orthodox psychiatry syndromes correctly. Supernatural and ultra-human views were rampant, and alternative mental health services were mostly preferred. Quantitative modes of assessment were the most common, and authors-especially those that adopted this mode of assessment-did not take full cognizance of socio-cultural underpinnings of the concept of mental health literacy in their conclusion and recommendations.|There is need for more studies to adopt more comprehensive approaches to the assessment of mental health literacy. The outcomes of such studies will provide the right context for making profound statements on the level of knowledge and skills for mental health promotion in sub-Saharan Africa.

25164288	<TITLE>Toward a unified view of cognitive control.</TITLE>Allen Newell (1973) once observed that psychology researchers were playing "twenty questions with nature," carving up human cognition into hundreds of individual phenomena but shying away from the difficult task of integrating these phenomena with unifying theories. We argue that research on cognitive control has followed a similar path, and that the best approach toward unifying theories of cognitive control is that proposed by Newell, namely developing theories in computational cognitive architectures. Threaded cognition, a recent theory developed within the ACT-R cognitive architecture, offers promise as a unifying theory of cognitive control that addresses multitasking phenomena for both laboratory and applied task domains.

25207977	<TITLE>Evolving molecular epidemiological profile of human immunodeficiency virus 1 in the southwest border of China.</TITLE>We have previously reported in Xishuangbanna (Banna) Dai Autonomous Prefecture, a well-developed tourist destination in the southwest border of China, that HIV-1 transmitted dominantly through heterosexual contact with less divergent genotypes and few drug resistant mutations. Due to the rapid increase of newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases per year in Banna in recent years, it's important to evaluate the evolution of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology for the better understanding of ongoing HIV-1 outbreak in this region.|By sequencing of HIV-1 pol genes and phylogenetic analysis, we conducted a molecular epidemiologic study in 352 HIV-1-seropositive highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)-naïve individuals newly diagnosed at the Banna Center for Disease Control and Prevention between 2009 and 2011. Of 283 samples (84.1% taken from heterosexually acquired adults, 10.6% from needle-sharing drug users, 2.8% from men who have sex with men, 0.4% from children born from HIV-1-infected mothers, and 2.1% remained unknown) with successful sequencing for pol gene, we identified 108 (38.2%) HIV-1 subtype CRF08_BC, 101 (35.7%) CRF01_AE, 49 (17.3%) CRF07_BC, 5 (1.8%) C/CRF57_BC, 3 (1.1%) B', 1 (0.4%) B/CRF51_01B, and 16 (5.7%) unique recombinants forms. Among these infected individuals, 104 (36.7%) cases showed drug resistant or resistance-relevant mutations, and 4 of them conferring high-level resistance to 3TC/FTC, EFV/NVP or NFV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 21 clusters (2-7 sequences) with only 21.2% (60/283) sequences involved.|In contrast to our previous findings, CRF08_BC, replaced CRF01_AE, became the dominant genotype of HIV-1 in Banna prefecture. The viral strains with drug resistance mutations were detected frequently in newly diagnosed HIV-1-infected individuals in this region.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25230183	<TITLE>Analysis of the phenolic composition of fungus-resistant grape varieties cultivated in Italy and Germany using UHPLC-MS/MS.</TITLE>The phenolic composition of grape berries grown in Italy (Cabernet Cortis, Johanniter, Solaris, Phoenix, and Regent) and in Germany (Regent and Phoenix) was analyzed using two complementary LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry) methods. These five cultivars belong to fungus-resistant grape varieties (PIWI) and little is known about their phenolic profile, although phenolics such as phytoalexins have been recognized, playing a key role in the resistance mechanism. A triple quadruple mass spectrometer detector was used for both identification and quantification, and analytical tools from untargeted metabolomics were applied to check and control the quality of the results. Specifically, biological, technical, and instrumental replications were included in order to study the variability at different levels. The results allowed tuning of the sampling protocol and provided a rich phenolic metabolite profile for the aforementioned PIWI varieties, as compared with Vitis vinifera cultivars, especially in the class of stilbenes.

25276166	<TITLE>NLRP3 and downstream cytokine expression elevated in the monocytes of patients with coronary artery disease.</TITLE>Pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated signaling pathways have recently been elucidated to bridge the innate immune system and atherosclerosis. NLRP3 is among the family members of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a type of PRRs. At present, most studies about the NLRP3 inflammasome focus on animal models and immune cells. Limited information is available regarding the role of NLRP3 in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).|In this study, we observed the expression of NLRP3 and downstream cytokines in patients with CAD by ELISA, real-time qPCR and Western blot.|We found that NLRP3 and downstream cytokines were coupled with increasing severity of CAD and a dynamic variation exists in patients with acute myocardial infarction. We also found that NLRP3 was correlated with Gensini score, indicating that NLRP3 might be relevant not only for the severity of CAD but also for the severity of coronary atherosclerosis.|This study provides a new theoretical basis for innate immune participation in atherosclerosis development and highlights the potential of the NLRP3 inflammasome as a target for prevention and treatment of CAD.

25334024	<TITLE>Understanding the mechanism of atovaquone drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum cytochrome b mutation Y268S using computational methods.</TITLE>The rapid appearance of resistant malarial parasites after introduction of atovaquone (ATQ) drug has prompted the search for new drugs as even single point mutations in the active site of Cytochrome b protein can rapidly render ATQ ineffective. The presence of Y268 mutations in the Cytochrome b (Cyt b) protein is previously suggested to be responsible for the ATQ resistance in Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). In this study, we examined the resistance mechanism against ATQ in P. falciparum through computational methods. Here, we reported a reliable protein model of Cyt bc1 complex containing Cyt b and the Iron-Sulphur Protein (ISP) of P. falciparum using composite modeling method by combining threading, ab initio modeling and atomic-level structure refinement approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Y268S mutation causes ATQ resistance by reducing hydrophobic interactions between Cyt bc1 protein complex and ATQ. Moreover, the important histidine contact of ATQ with the ISP chain is also lost due to Y268S mutation. We noticed the induced mutation alters the arrangement of active site residues in a fashion that enforces ATQ to find its new stable binding site far away from the wild-type binding pocket. The MM-PBSA calculations also shows that the binding affinity of ATQ with Cyt bc1 complex is enough to hold it at this new site that ultimately leads to the ATQ resistance.

25374437	<TITLE>Comparison of Anxiolytic Effects of Acute Exercise in Older Versus Younger Adults.</TITLE>Although the anxiolytic effect of acute exercise is well established, there is little understanding regarding whether this effect differs across age. The purpose of this investigation was to compare anxiolytic effects of acute exercise in older versus younger volunteers. Older (n = 32, aged 59-75 years) and younger (n = 45, aged 18-30 years), aerobically fit volunteers were assessed. On 3 consecutive days, participants ran/walked for 60 min at 65% to 75% of heart-rate reserve. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y1) was administered 5 min before and 20 min after each exercise bout. Mean state anxiety before and after exercise was analyzed by repeated measures age-by-gender-by-time ANOVA. A significantly greater anxiolytic effect of exercise in the older versus younger participants was found for the mean data (p < .001), as well as each of the 3 individual days. The results suggest greater anxiolytic effects of vigorous acute exercise in older compared to younger adults.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25378150	<TITLE>Mirror neuron activation prior to action observation in a predictable context.</TITLE>A fundamental capacity of social animals consists in the predictive representation of upcoming events in the outside world, such as the actions of others. Here, we tested the activity of ventral premotor area F5 mirror neurons (MNs) while monkeys observed an experimenter performing (Action condition) or withholding (Inaction condition) a grasping action, which could be predicted on the basis of previously presented auditory instructions. Many of the recorded MNs discharged only during action observation (Action MNs), but one-third also encoded the experimenter's withheld action (Inaction MNs). Interestingly, while most of Action MNs exhibited reactive discharge during action observation, becoming active after the go signal, the majority of Inaction MNs showed predictive discharge. MN population activity as a whole displayed an overall predictive activation pattern, becoming active, on average, 340 ms before the go signal. Furthermore, MNs became active earlier when the observed action was performed in the monkeys' extrapersonal rather than peripersonal space, suggesting that context-based neural prediction of others' actions plays different roles depending on the monkeys' ability to interact with the observed agent.

Twenty-four first-ever infratentorial stroke patients between 18 and 60 years of age were enrolled. WMH was evaluated by the Fazekas scale and the Scheltens scale. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Korean Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Seoul Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (SCNT) at one month after stroke. All participants were divided into two groups based on the presence of WMH (no-WMH group and WMH group). General characteristics and cognitive functions were compared between the groups.|There were no significant differences in general characteristics, such as age, stroke type, hypertension history, and education level between the two groups. However, K-MMSE in the WMH group was significantly lower compared to the no-WMH group (p<0.05). The verbal learning test score in SCNT was significantly higher in the no-WMH group compared to the WMH group (p<0.05). Executive function in the no-WMH group tended to be higher compared to the WMH group.|Impairment of cognitive function in patients with infratentorial stroke appeared to be associated with WMH.

25400510	<TITLE>A cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest rat model for the investigation of the systemic inflammation response and induced organ damage.</TITLE>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a commonly used technique in cardiac surgery. CPB is however associated with a strong induction of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which in conjunction with ischemia and reperfusion may lead to multiple organ failure. The aim of the study was to establish and characterize a CPB rat model incorporating deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with a specific focus on the extent of the inflammatory reactions and organ damage as a groundwork for novel therapeutics against SIRS and I/R induced organ injury.|Male Wistar rats (n = 6) were cannulated for CPB, connected to a heart-lung-machine (HLM) and cooled to a temperature of 16°C before they underwent 45 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with global ischaemia. Arrest was followed by rewarming and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Haemodynamic and vital parameters were recorded throughout the CPB procedure. Only animals displaying sinus rhythm throughout reperfusion were utilized for analysis. Rats were euthanized and tissue samples were harvested. Blood gas analysis was performed and blood samples were taken. Induction of organ damage was examined by analysis of protein levels and phosphorylation status of kinases and stress proteins. Results were compared to animals (n = 6) which did not undergo CPB.|CPB induced leucocytosis and an increase of interleukin-6 and TNF-α plasma values indicating an inflammatory response. Markers of tissue damage and dysfunction, such as troponin T, creatinine and AST were elevated. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was induced in all examined organs. Activation of MAPK and induction of heat shock proteins occurred in an organ-specific manner with most pronounced effects in heart, lungs and kidneys.|The presented CPB rat model shows the induction of SIRS and activation of specific signalling cascades. SIRS seems not to be provoked during DHCA and is elicited mainly during reperfusion. This model might be suitable to test the efficacy of therapeutics applied in major heart surgery with and without DHCA.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25479029	<TITLE>Socioeconomic status and hypertension: a meta-analysis.</TITLE>The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and hypertension has been studied in a number of reviews. However, the impact of SES on hypertension has been reported in several studies with conflicting results.|A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Proquest and Cochrane databases for observational studies on hypertension prevalence and SES, published in English, until March 2014. Hypertension was defined as a mean SBP of at least 140 mmHg or a DBP of at least 90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. The inverse variance method with a random-effects model was used to pool the risk estimates from the individual studies. Data abstraction was conducted independently by two authors.|Among the 2404 references, 51 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An overall increased risk of hypertension among the lowest SES was found for all three indicators: income [pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.48], occupation (pooled OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.64) and education (pooled OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.55-2.63). The associations were significant in high-income countries, and the increased risk of hypertension for the lowest categories of all SES indicators was most evident for women, whereas men revealed less consistent associations.|Low SES is associated with higher blood pressure, and this association is particularly evident in the level of education. It is important to identify and monitor hypertension to reduce the risk of this disease among the most vulnerable groups in different countries and among different societies.

25503558	<TITLE>Acute tissue injury activates satellite cells and promotes sarcoma formation via the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway.</TITLE>Some patients with soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) report a history of injury at the site of their tumor. Although this phenomenon is widely reported, there are relatively few experimental systems that have directly assessed the role of injury in sarcoma formation. We recently described a mouse model of STS whereby p53 is deleted and oncogenic Kras is activated in muscle satellite cells via a Pax7(CreER) driver following intraperitoneal injection with tamoxifen. Here, we report that after systemic injection of tamoxifen, the vast majority of Pax7-expressing cells remain quiescent despite mutation of p53 and Kras. The fate of these muscle progenitors is dramatically altered by tissue injury, which leads to faster kinetics of sarcoma formation. In adult muscle, quiescent satellite cells will transition into an active state in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We show that modulating satellite cell quiescence via intramuscular injection of HGF increases the penetrance of sarcoma formation at the site of injection, which is dependent on its cognate receptor c-MET. Unexpectedly, the tumor-promoting effect of tissue injury also requires c-Met. These results reveal a mechanism by which HGF/c-MET signaling promotes tumor formation after tissue injury in a mouse model of primary STS, and they may explain why some patients develop a STS at the site of injury.

25571003	<TITLE>Towards robust HD EMG pattern recognition: reducing electrode displacement effect using structural similarity.</TITLE>Even small changes of electrode recording sites after training a classifier heavily influence robustness and usability of traditional pattern recognition-based myoelectric control schemes. This effect occurs during donning and doffing of the prosthesis or when changing the arm position and generally leads to a significant decrease of classification accuracy. On the other hand, image representations taken from high density electromyographic (EMG) signals offer high spatial resolution and only seem to change slightly during electrode shift, preserving most structural information. In this paper, we present a simple one-against-one nearest neighbor classifier based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). SSIM quantifies visual similarity of two images based on decomposition into three components: luminance, contrast and structure. Our experimental results indicate that an SSIM-based classifier can outperform an LDA-based classifier using structural information taken from high density EMG signals during simulated electrode shift.

25574184	<TITLE>Trend and pattern of herb and supplement use in the United States: results from the 2002, 2007, and 2012 national health interview surveys.</TITLE>Background. In 1990s, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including use of herbs and supplements, gained popularity in the United States. However, more recent surveys suggest that demand for herbs and supplements has stabilized. Objective. This study examined the prevalence, patterns, and changes in herb and supplement use among the US adults, using the 2002, 2007, and 2012 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). Methods. Weighted population estimates were derived from three complementary and alternative medicine supplements to the NHIS. Prevalence rates for herb and supplement use were compared, using Wald chi-square tests to measure changes between years. Results. An estimated 40.6 million US adults reported herb and supplement use in 2012. However, the rate of herb and supplement use dropped from 18.9% in 2002 to 17.9% in 2007 and 2012 (P < 0.05). This decline in use was more pronounced among women, racial or ethnic minorities, and adults with low incomes. Conclusion. Herb and supplements use remains common in the USA, but adult use rates are on the decline. It is still important for health care providers to ask patients about herb and supplement use.

25599117	<TITLE>Letter to the editor concerning the article "Effects of acoustic feedback training in elite-standard Para-Rowing" by Schaffert and Mattes (2015).</TITLE>In a case study, Schaffert and Mattes reported the application of acoustic feedback (sonification) to optimise the time course of boat acceleration. The authors attributed an increased boat speed in the feedback condition to an optimised boat acceleration (mainly during the recovery phase). However, in rowing it is biomechanically impossible to increase the boat speed significantly by reducing the fluctuations in boat acceleration during the rowing cycle. To assess such a, potentially small, optimising effect experimentally, the confounding variables must be controlled very accurately (that is especially the propulsive forces must be kept constant between experimental conditions or the differences in propulsive forces between conditions must be much smaller than the effects on boat speed resulting from an optimised movement pattern). However, this was not controlled adequately by the authors. Instead, the presented boat acceleration data show that the increased boat speed under acoustic feedback was due to increased propulsive forces.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25735496	<TITLE>A structural model of age, grey matter volumes, education, and personality traits.</TITLE>When the relationship between ageing and changes in personality traits is considered, it is important to know how they are influenced by biological and environmental factors. The present study examined the relationships between various factors associated with the effect of ageing on personality traits, including structural changes of the brain and environmental factors such as education.|We recruited 41 healthy subjects. We administered the NEO Five-Factor Inventory to assess personality factors. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and regional grey matter (GM) volumes were obtained. We identified associations in the correlation analysis of age, cerebral GM volume, years of education, and the personality trait of openness. Path analysis was used to estimate the relationships among these factors.|The path analysis model of age, GM volume, years of education, and the personality trait of openness revealed that age has an indirect negative association with openness through GM volume and years of education. Ageing was related to a decrease in GM volume, which was in turn related to a decrease in the openness score. Older subjects generally had fewer years of education, which was related to a lower openness score.|Maintaining openness against the effects of ageing is desirable, and our results imply that interventions against age-related cerebral atrophy and the promotion of opportunities for higher education may contribute to the development and stability of a healthy personality during the adult life course.

25742525	<TITLE>Innervated Reverse Digital Artery Island Flap through Bilateral Neurorrhaphy using Direct Small Branches of the Proper Digital Nerve.</TITLE>The reverse digital artery flap uses the radial or ulnar surface of the proximal phalanx of the involved digit and has been applied to sensate flaps using the superficial sensory nerve branch and the dorsal branch of the proper digital nerve. As these nerve branches innervate the dorsal surface of the finger, however, hypesthesia of the dorsal side of the middle phalanx is inevitable.|Thirty fingers of 25 patients who had the innervated reverse digital artery flap using direct small branches of the proper digital nerve were included in this study. The minimum follow-up duration was 24 months, and the average defect size was 2.8 cm(2).|In all cases, the pulp defects were successfully reconstructed with this flap. The average size of the donor flap was 3.9 cm(2). At 6 months after surgery, the average static two-point discrimination value was 5.9 mm, the average moving two-point discrimination value was 5.0 mm, and the average Semmes-Weinstein monofilament score was 3.79. At 1 year postoperatively, the average Cold Intolerance Severity Score was 20. The percentage total active motion was measured at 99 percent 2 years after surgery.|Because this flap does not sacrifice the proper digital nerve or dorsal branch of the nerve, the sensibility of the dorsal aspect of the proximal and middle phalanx can be preserved. This flap is cosmetically excellent, as it uses a donor flap similar to the injured fingertip and the donor scar can be hidden by adjacent fingers.|Therapeutic, IV.

25744158	<TITLE>Gastrointestinal tolerance of erythritol-containing beverage in young children: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.</TITLE>To determine gastrointestinal (GI) responses and maximum tolerated dose of erythritol in young children given as a single oral dose in a 250-ml non-carbonated fruit-flavoured beverage in between meals. This is a multicentre double-blind study with sequential design for multiple dose groups and randomised crossover for comparators of placebo vs dose.|A total of 185 healthy young children aged 4-6 years were recruited at three clinical investigation centres after informed consent of both parents; 184 children completed the study. Children were included in one of the four dose groups (5, 15, 20 or 25 g erythritol) and exposed randomly to only one single dose vs an isosweet sucrose placebo. After consumption in the clinic and an observation period, GI symptoms and stooling patterns were recorded during the next 48 h.|Statistically significantly more episodes of diarrhoea and/or severe GI symptoms were observed in the 20 and 25  g groups compared with placebo, but not in the 5 and 15  g groups. Stool consistency, as measured by Bristol stool scale, was lower in the 15-, 20- and 25 g groups for the first 24 -h period, but not at later time points. Incidences of nausea, vomiting, borborygmi, excess flatus and abdominal pain were not significantly different from the placebo controls at all doses of erythritol.|Rapid ingestion of up to and including 15 g (6% w/v) of erythritol in a beverage in between meals by young children aged 4-6 years was well tolerated. The no observed effect level for diarrhoea and/or severe GI symptoms was 15 g (0.73 g/kg body weight (bw)). Children appeared not to be more sensitive to the GI effects of erythritol than published for adults on a g/kg bw basis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25860443	<TITLE>Genetically encoded fragment-based discovery of glycopeptide ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins.</TITLE>We describe an approach to accelerate the search for competitive inhibitors for carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). Genetically encoded fragment-based discovery (GE-FBD) uses selection of phage-displayed glycopeptides to dock a glycan fragment at the CRD and guide selection of synergistic peptide motifs adjacent to the CRD. Starting from concanavalin A (ConA), a mannose (Man)-binding protein, as a bait, we narrowed a library of 10(8) glycopeptides to 86 leads that share a consensus motif, Man-WYD. Validation of synthetic leads yielded Man-WYDLF that exhibited 40-50-fold enhancement in affinity over methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (MeMan). Lectin array suggested specificity: Man-WYD derivative bound only to 3 out of 17 proteins—ConA, LcH, and PSA—that bind to Man. An X-ray structure of ConA:Man-WYD proved that the trimannoside core and Man-WYD exhibit identical CRD docking, but their extra-CRD binding modes are significantly different. Still, they have comparable affinity and selectivity for various Man-binding proteins. The intriguing observation provides new insight into functional mimicry of carbohydrates by peptide ligands. GE-FBD may provide an alternative to rapidly search for competitive inhibitors for lectins.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25896935	<TITLE>Impact of smoking and smoking cessation on cardiovascular events and mortality among older adults: meta-analysis of individual participant data from prospective cohort studies of the CHANCES consortium.</TITLE>To investigate the impact of smoking and smoking cessation on cardiovascular mortality, acute coronary events, and stroke events in people aged 60 and older, and to calculate and report risk advancement periods for cardiovascular mortality in addition to traditional epidemiological relative risk measures.|Individual participant meta-analysis using data from 25 cohorts participating in the CHANCES consortium. Data were harmonised, analysed separately employing Cox proportional hazard regression models, and combined by meta-analysis.|Overall, 503,905 participants aged 60 and older were included in this study, of whom 37,952 died from cardiovascular disease. Random effects meta-analysis of the association of smoking status with cardiovascular mortality yielded a summary hazard ratio of 2.07 (95% CI 1.82 to 2.36) for current smokers and 1.37 (1.25 to 1.49) for former smokers compared with never smokers. Corresponding summary estimates for risk advancement periods were 5.50 years (4.25 to 6.75) for current smokers and 2.16 years (1.38 to 2.39) for former smokers. The excess risk in smokers increased with cigarette consumption in a dose-response manner, and decreased continuously with time since smoking cessation in former smokers. Relative risk estimates for acute coronary events and for stroke events were somewhat lower than for cardiovascular mortality, but patterns were similar.|Our study corroborates and expands evidence from previous studies in showing that smoking is a strong independent risk factor of cardiovascular events and mortality even at older age, advancing cardiovascular mortality by more than five years, and demonstrating that smoking cessation in these age groups is still beneficial in reducing the excess risk.

25900286	<TITLE>Urodynamic or video-urodynamic assessment in patients with spinal cord injury: this is not a question!</TITLE>Case report.|The objective of this study was to demonstrate the additional value of combined video-urodynamic investigations compared with urodynamic investigation alone in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction due to spinal cord injury (SCI).|The study was conducted in a spinal cord injury rehabilitation center in Switzerland.|A patient with complete SCI since 1984 evacuated the bladder by reflex voiding. Owing to the lack of clinical symptoms, he refused urologic controls for 15 years. In July 2014, he was referred to our hospital with acute septicemia.|The hydronephrosis responsible for the septicemia was successfully treated by intravenous antibiotics and ureteral stenting. Subsequently, a neuro-urologic assessment was performed. Urodynamic examination was normal. Video-urodynamics, however, revealed massive morphologic alterations of the lower and upper urinary tracts, which were responsible for the septicemia.|Our case demonstrates the necessity of regular video-urodynamic controls even in asymptomatic SCI patients. Persons using triggered voiding may be at a higher risk for secondary changes, as a sustained detrusor pressure is necessary for this technique.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25912090	<TITLE>Combining various types of classifiers and features extracted from magnetic resonance imaging data in schizophrenia recognition.</TITLE>We investigated a combination of three classification algorithms, namely the modified maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis (mMLDA), the centroid method, and the average linkage, with three types of features extracted from three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) brain images, specifically MR intensities, grey matter densities, and local deformations for distinguishing 49 first episode schizophrenia male patients from 49 healthy male subjects. The feature sets were reduced using intersubject principal component analysis before classification. By combining the classifiers, we were able to obtain slightly improved results when compared with single classifiers. The best classification performance (81.6% accuracy, 75.5% sensitivity, and 87.8% specificity) was significantly better than classification by chance. We also showed that classifiers based on features calculated using more computation-intensive image preprocessing perform better; mMLDA with classification boundary calculated as weighted mean discriminative scores of the groups had improved sensitivity but similar accuracy compared to the original MLDA; reducing a number of eigenvectors during data reduction did not always lead to higher classification accuracy, since noise as well as the signal important for classification were removed. Our findings provide important information for schizophrenia research and may improve accuracy of computer-aided diagnostics of neuropsychiatric diseases.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
25963740	<TITLE>Pathway-based personalized analysis of breast cancer expression data.</TITLE>Most analyses of high throughput cancer data represent tumors by "atomistic" single-gene properties. Pathifier, a recently introduced method, characterizes a tumor in terms of "coarse grained" pathway-based variables.|We applied Pathifier to study a very large dataset of 2000 breast cancer samples and 144 normal tissues. Pathifier uses known gene assignments to pathways and biological processes to calculate for each pathway and tumor a Pathway Deregulation Score (PDS). Individual samples are represented in terms of their PDSs calculated for several hundred pathways, and the samples of the data set are analyzed and stratified on the basis of their profiles over these "coarse grained", biologically meaningful variables.|We identified nine tumor subtypes; a new subclass (comprising about 7% of the samples) exhibits high deregulation in 38 PKA pathways, induced by overexpression of the gene PRKACB. Another interesting finding is that basal tumors break into two subclasses, with low and high deregulation of a cluster of immune system pathways. High deregulation corresponds to higher concentrations of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, and the patients of this basal subtype have better prognosis. The analysis used 1000 "discovery set" tumors; our results were highly reproducible on 1000 independent "validation" samples.|The coarse-grained variables that represent pathway deregulation provide a basis for relevant, novel and robust findings for breast cancer. Our analysis indicates that in breast cancer reliable prognostic signatures are most likely to be obtained by treating separately different subgroups of the patients.

25980658	<TITLE>Total cyanide mass measurement with micro-ion selective electrode for determination of specific activity of carbon-11 cyanide.</TITLE>In this research, we aim to directly measure the specific activity (SA) of the carbon-11 cyanide ([(11)C]CN¯) produced by our in-house built automated [(11)C]HCN production system and to identify the major sources of (12)C-cyanide ((12)CN¯). The [(11)C]CN¯ is produced from [(11)C]CO2, which is generated by the (14)N(p,α)(11)C nuclear reaction using a cyclotron. Direct measurement of cyanide concentrations was accomplished using a relatively inexpensive, and easy to use ion selective electrode (ISE) which offered an appropriate range of sensitivity for detecting mass. Multiple components of the [(11)C]HCN production system were isolated in order to determine their relative contributions to (12)CN¯ mass. It was determined that the system gases were responsible for approximately 30% of the mass, and that the molecular sieve/nickel furnace unit contributed approximately 70% of the mass. Beam on target (33µA for 1 and 10min) did not contribute significantly to the mass. Additionally, we compared the SA of our [(11)C]HCN precursor determined using the ISE to the SA of our current [(11)C]CN¯ derived radiotracers determined by HPLC to assure there was no significant difference between the two methods. These results are the first reported use of an ion selective electrode to determine the SA of no-carrier-added cyanide ion, and clearly show that it is a valuable, inexpensive and readily available tool suitable for this purpose.

26038746	<TITLE>Characterization of a G1P[8] rotavirus causing an outbreak of gastroenteritis in the Northern Territory, Australia, in the vaccine era.</TITLE>In 2010, a large outbreak of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred in the Alice Springs region of the Northern Territory, Australia. The outbreak occurred 43 months after the introduction of the G1P[8] rotavirus vaccine Rotarix(®). Forty-three infants were hospitalized during the outbreak and analysis of fecal samples from each infant revealed a G1P[8] rotavirus strain. The outbreak strain was adapted to cell culture and neutralization assays were performed using VP7 and VP4 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The outbreak strain exhibited a distinct neutralization resistance pattern compared to the Rotarix(®) vaccine strain. Whole genome sequencing of the 2010 outbreak virus strain demonstrated numerous amino acid differences compared to the Rotarix(®) vaccine strain in the characterized neutralization epitopes of the VP7 and VP4 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the outbreak strain revealed a close genetic relationship to global strains, in particular RVA/Human-wt/BEL/BE0098/2009/G1P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/BEL/BE00038/2008/G1P[8] for numerous genes. The 2010 outbreak strain was likely introduced from a globally circulating population of strains rather than evolving from an endemic Australian strain. The outbreak strain possessed antigenic differences in the VP7 and VP4 proteins compared to the Rotarix(®) vaccine strain. The outbreak was associated with moderate vaccine coverage and possibly low vaccine take in the population.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
26047632	<TITLE>Clinical decision support system for end-stage kidney disease risk estimation in IgA nephropathy patients.</TITLE>The progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) depends on several factors that are not quite clear and tangle the risk assessment. We aimed at developing a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for a quantitative risk assessment of ESKD and its timing using available clinical data at the time of renal biopsy.|We included a total of 1040 biopsy-proven IgAN patients with long-term follow-up from Italy (N = 546), Norway (N = 441) and Japan (N = 53). Of these, 241 patients reached ESKD: 104 Italian [median time to ESKD = 5 (3-9) years], 134 Norwegian [median time to ESKD = 6 (2-11) years] and 3 Japanese [median time to ESKD = 3 (2-12) years]. We independently trained and validated two cooperating artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting first the ESKD status and then the time to ESKD (defined as three categories: ≤ 3 years, between > 3 and 8 years and over 8 years). As inputs we used gender, age, histological grading, serum creatinine, 24-h proteinuria and hypertension at the time of renal biopsy.|The ANNs demonstrated high performance for both the prediction of ESKD (with an AUC of 89.9, 93.3 and 100% in the Italian, Norwegian and Japanese IgAN population, respectively) and its timing (f-measure of 90.7% in the cohort from Italy and 70.8% in the one from Norway). We embedded the two ANNs in a CDSS available online (www.igan.net). Entering the clinical parameters at the time of renal biopsy, the CDSS returns as output the estimated risk and timing of ESKD for the patient.|This CDSS provides useful additional information for identifying 'high-risk' IgAN patients and may help stratify them in the context of a personalized medicine approach.

26169595	<TITLE>Ultrasound versus anatomical landmarks for caudal epidural anesthesia in pediatric patients.</TITLE>Caudal block is easily performed because the landmarks are superficial. However, the sacral hiatus is small and shallow in pediatric patients. In the present study, we evaluated under general anesthesia whether the distance between the bilateral superolateral sacral crests increased with growth, whether an equilateral triangle was formed between the apex of the sacral hiatus and the bilateral superolateral sacral crests, and whether expansion of the epidural space could be confirmed by ultrasound.|This prospective observational study included 282 children who were ASA I-II. Under general anesthesia, each patient was placed in the lateral bent knees position, and the attending anesthesiologist drew an equilateral triangle and measured the distance between the bilateral superolateral sacral crests along a line forming the base of the triangle. Then the sacral hiatus was identified by ultrasound. Differences of the distance between the anatomical landmarks measured by the anesthetist and by ultrasound were evaluated.|Two patients were excluded because the superolateral sacral crests and sacral hiatus could not be palpated. The base of the triangle increased in proportion to age up to 10 years old, with a significant correlation between age and the length of the base (Spearman's r value = 0.97). The triangle was not an equilateral triangle under 7 years old. The sacral hiatus could be identified by ultrasound and we could confirm expansion of the epidural space in all patients.|We observed a correlation between age and the length of the triangle base in children under 10 years old. Although detection of the anatomical landmarks by palpation differed from identification by ultrasound in pediatric patients, performing ultrasound is important. Epinephrine should be added to the anesthetic to avoid complications.|Current Controlled Trials UMIN000017898 . Registered 14 June 2015.

26224905	<TITLE>Why is monoalkylation versus bis-alkylation of the Ni(II) complex of the Schiff base of (S)-N-(2-benzoylphenyl)-1-benzylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide and glycine so selective? MP2 modelling and topological QTAIM analysis of chiral metallocomplex synthons of α-amino acids used for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography.</TITLE>Chiral Ni(II) complexes are used for the preparation of carbon-11 or fluorine-18 enantiomerically pure α-amino acids for positron emission tomography (PET). They enable the selective monoalkylation of a glycine synthon with high stereoselectivity and the preparation of enantiomerically pure α-amino acids with quarternary α-carbon. Molecular modelling of non-, mono- and di-substituted complexes using quantum theory of atoms-in-molecule (QTAIM) topological analysis of electron density allowed us to formulate a new theory explaining the reasons for highly selective monomethylation of the complexes. In the non-substituted complex (GK), the α-carbon atom exhibits a higher atomic volume and a more positive charge in comparison with mono- and di-substituted complexes. This unusual behaviour is accompanied by increasing the bond critical point (BCP) ellipticity of the iminic bond in GK explained by the higher mechanical strain. Both phenomena indicate the increased reactivity and probably originate in more compact core of GK where shorter distances in the internal coordination sphere result in the higher strain of its bonds.

26294388	<TITLE>Dual effects of fibroblast growth factor 21 on hepatic energy metabolism.</TITLE>The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) affects hepatic integration of carbohydrate and fat metabolism in Siberian hamsters, a natural model of adiposity. Twelve aged matched adult male Siberian hamsters maintained in their long-day fat state since birth were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and were continuously infused with either vehicle (saline; n=6) or recombinant human FGF21 protein (1 mg/kg per day; n=6) for 14 days. FGF21 administration caused a 40% suppression (P<0.05) of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the rate-limiting step in glucose oxidation, a 34% decrease (P<0.05) in hepatic acetylcarnitine accumulation, an index of reduced PDC flux, a 35% increase (P<0.05) in long-chain acylcarnitine content (an index of flux through β-oxidation) and a 47% reduction (P<0.05) in hepatic lipid content. These effects were underpinned by increased protein abundance of PD kinase-4 (PDK4, a negative regulator of PDC), the phosphorylated (inhibited) form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, a negative regulator of delivery of fatty acids into the mitochondria) and the transcriptional co-regulators of energy metabolism peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator alpha (PGC1α) and sirtuin-1. These findings provide novel mechanistic basis to support the notion that FGF21 exerts profound metabolic benefits in the liver by modulating nutrient flux through both carbohydrate (mediated by a PDK4-mediated suppression of PDC activity) and fat (mediated by deactivation of ACC) metabolism, and therefore may be an attractive target for protection from increased hepatic lipid content and insulin resistance that frequently accompany obesity and diabetes.

26357474	<TITLE>Apoptosis and necrosis induced by novel realgar quantum dots in human endometrial cancer cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway.</TITLE>Realgar (AS4S4) has been used in traditional medicines for malignancy, but the poor water solubility is still a major hindrance to its clinical use. Realgar quantum dots (RQDs) were therefore synthesized with improved water solubility and bioavailability. Human endometrial cancer JEC cells were exposed to various concentrations of RQDs to evaluate their anticancer effects and to explore mechanisms by the MTT assay, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), flow cytometry, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Results revealed that the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of the prepared RQDs was up to approximately 70%, with the average size of 5.48 nm. RQDs induced antipro-liferative activity against JEC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In light microscopy and TEM examinations, RQDs induced vacuolization and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dilation in JEC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ER stress by RQDs were further confirmed by increased expression of GADD153 and GRP78 at both mRNA and protein levels. ER stress further led to JEC cell apoptosis and necrosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and mitochondrial membrane potential detection. Our findings demonstrated that the newly synthesized RQDs were effective against human endometrial cancer cells. The underlying mechanism appears to be, at least partly, due to ER stress leading to apoptotic cell death and necrosis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Totally 145 patients were included in the study. Information on patient demographics and laboratory data were obtained from patient records. The study participants were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the CD-alone group consisting of patients without any other autoimmune diseases (AIDs), while group 2 was the PAI group consisting of patients with accompanying one or more AIDs.|The mean age of 145 CD patients (106 female and 39 male) included in the study was 37.2 ± 12.3 years. Of the 145 patients included, 48 (33.1%) were in the PAI group. When two groups were compared with each other in terms of the demographic features and laboratory data, the following were identified as risk factors for PAI: female gender, family history for AIDs, antigliadin IgG positivity, vitamin D deficiency, antinuclear antibody positivity ≥1/80 titer and having any musculoskeletal disease.|To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies in the literature on CD patients for the PAI prevalence and related risk factors. Identification of the risk factors in early stages is important to explore PAI among CD patients. Larger, prospective studies are warranted about the risk factors and autoimmune characteristics of CD.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
26406339	<TITLE>New Epidemiological and Clinical Signatures of 18 Pathogens from Respiratory Tract Infections Based on a 5-Year Study.</TITLE>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a heavy burden on society. However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries.|To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs.|Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) > 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) > respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) >Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) > human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics.|IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies.

26408378	<TITLE>Acute Arterial Thrombosis of the Hand.</TITLE>Arterial thrombosis of the hand occurs infrequently but may result in considerable morbidity and compromise of hand function. The hand surgeon may be called upon to direct management in cases of acute arterial thrombosis of the hand and should have an understanding of the available diagnostic tools and treatment modalities. This article discusses the vascular anatomy of the hand and clinical manifestations of arterial thrombosis. Differences between isolated thrombosis and diffuse intravascular injury are detailed, and treatment options for these conditions are described. Appropriate care often requires coordination with interventional radiologists or vascular surgeons. Outcomes after treatment of arterial thrombosis of the hand are variable, and prognosis may be related to whether isolated thrombosis or diffuse intravascular injury is present.

26418029	<TITLE>Synthesis, crystal structure and properties of the new superconductors TaRuB and NbOsB.</TITLE>Two new ternary compounds TaRuB and NbOsB were synthesized by arc-melting and annealing at 1500-1850 °C. They crystallize in orthorhombic primitive structures with space group Pbam. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements reveal bulk superconductivity for metallic TaRuB with a T(c) ≈ 4 K. Electronic structure calculations by DFT methods show that 4d and 5d transition-metal states dominate the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level E(F) with a pronounced quasi one-dimensional behaviour along the [0 0 1] direction. Comparison of the calculated DOS at E(F) with specific heat data reveals a moderate electron-phonon coupling. Possible small boron vacancies could significantly reduce the DOS at E(F), hence decrease T(c) for samples annealed at higher temperatures. For NbOsB, the DOS(E(F)) is strongly reduced due to an increase of covalent bonding interactions between Os and B. Accordingly, a lower T(c) ≈ 1 K is observed.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
26420891	<TITLE>Lessons From Early Implementation of a Patient-Centered Care Model in Oncology.</TITLE>Oncology practices may serve as the primary health provider for patients with cancer and the so-called neighbor during periods of transition and survivorship. New standards for patient-centered oncology practice articulate expectations for the primary health provider and neighbor roles. We report the implementation experiences of five oncology practices participating in a pilot of these standards.|For each practice, auditors reviewed workflows and documentation supporting the progress of the practice in meeting the oncology medical home standards. We also observed clinical encounters and practice workflow and interviewed clinicians, staff, and patients.|Referral coordination and care management were the most demonstrated functions. The least commonly demonstrated functions related to tracking and coordination of tests and medications, as well as quality measurement and improvement. Some opportunities for structural and process improvement included improving the use of health information technology, care coordination, quality improvement, telephone triage, symptom management, patient education, financial counseling, and care team communication. Making patient-centered care a priority and motivation to change were cited as facilitators for transformation.|The pilot oncology practices had many structures and processes in common, many of which were established during the early intervention period of this pilot. However, there was little standardization within and across practices in the way these processes were established and documented. Establishing structures for care coordination, quality improvement, and quality measurement should be priorities for practices considering transformation to a patient-centered model of care.

26454043	<TITLE>Process design for augmentation and spectrofluorometric quantification of neutral lipid by judicious doping of pathway intermediate in the culture of marine Chlorella variabilis for biodiesel application.</TITLE>Over the past few years microalgae have emerged as the most promising feedstock for biodiesel production. However, enhancing lipid content remains a major scientific challenge. Many studies irrationally rely upon nitrogen starvation for improving lipid content at the cost of biomass. In this study, strategic enhancement of neutral lipid without compromising with biomass production was achieved in marine Chlorella variabilis by supplementing the culture with triacylglycerol pathway intermediate, citric acid (1 g L(-1) pure and 0.5 g L(-1) orange peel extract as a low cost substitute). The microalga accumulated 17% and 34% (on dry cell weight basis) more neutral lipid, when cultivated in with citric acid and orange peel extract as supplements respectively, without any adverse effect on growth. The medium supplemented with orange peel extract stimulated better growth than that supplemented with citric acid. Gas chromatography studies validated that both the supplemented media yielded desired fatty acid composition for biodiesel production.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
26500389	<TITLE>College Students' Perceptions of Depressed Mood: Exploring Accuracy and Associations.</TITLE>College is a time of high risk for depressed mood. Theories about depression (i.e. Cognitive Theory and Depressive Realism theory) are well researched, but suggest different venues of understanding the cognitive underpinnings of mood. In addition, much research is available about normative perceptions around substance use and how those perceptions relate to behaviors. However, there are no studies examining normative perceptions around depressed mood nor how these perceptions may relate to students' own well-being. Undergraduates (N=1577) ages 18-24 responded to an online survey as part of a larger study on drinking and depressed mood. The survey assessed symptoms of depression and feelings of sadness, depression and suicidal ideation experienced in the past 2 weeks, as well as students' perceptions of the prevalence of these feelings among other students. Rates of sadness and depression reported in the sample were relatively high; whereas rates of reported suicidal ideation were low. Most students under-estimated the prevalence of sadness and depression experienced by other students; a finding that was especially true for male students. Conversely, most students over-estimated the prevalence of suicidal ideation. Students who reported experiencing a given feeling in the past two weeks perceived greater rates of the feeling among other students.

26550498	<TITLE>Delirium Accompanied by Cholinergic Deficiency and Organ Failure in a 73-Year-Old Critically Ill Patient: Physostigmine as a Therapeutic Option.</TITLE>Delirium is a common problem in ICU patients, resulting in prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality. A cholinergic deficiency in the central nervous system is supposed to be a relevant pathophysiologic process in delirium. Acetylcholine is a major transmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system influencing several organs (e.g., heart and kidneys) and the inflammatory response too. This perception might explain that delirium is not an individual symptom, but rather a part of a symptom complex with various disorders of the whole organism. The cholinergic deficiency could not be quantified up to now. Using the possibility of bedside determination of the acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE activity), we assumed to objectify the cholinergic homeostasis within minutes. As reported here, the postoperative delirium was accompanied by a massive hemodynamic and renal deterioration of unclear genesis. We identified the altered AChE activity as a plausible pathophysiological mechanism. The pharmacological intervention with the indirect parasympathomimetic physostigmine led to a quick and lasting improvement of the patient's cognitive, hemodynamic, and renal status. In summary, severe delirium is not always an attendant phenomenon of critical illness. It might be causal for multiple organ deterioration if it is based on cholinergic deficiency and has to be treated at his pathophysiological roots whenever possible.

26639197	<TITLE>Bone marrow PMN-MDSCs and neutrophils are functionally similar in protection of multiple myeloma from chemotherapy.</TITLE>Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of plasma cells localized preferentially in the bone marrow (BM). Resistance to chemotherapy represents one of the main challenges in MM management. BM microenvironment is known to play a critical role in protection of MM cells from chemotherapeutics; however, mechanisms responsible for this effect are largely unknown. Development of MM is associated with accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) mostly represented by pathologically activated relatively immature polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN-MDSCs). Here, we investigated whether PMN-MDSCs are responsible for BM microenvironment-mediated MM chemoresistance. Using in vivo mouse models allowing manipulation of myeloid cell number, we demonstrated a critical role for myeloid cells in MM growth and chemoresistance. PMN-MDSCs isolated from MM-bearing host are immunosuppressive and thus, functionally distinct from their counterpart in tumor-free host neutrophils. We found, however, that both PMN-MDSCs and neutrophils equally promote MM survival from doxorubicin and melphalan and that this effect is mediated by soluble factors rather than direct cell-cell contact. Our data indicate that targeting PMN-MDSCs would enhance chemotherapy efficacy in MM.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
26683379	<TITLE>Associations between cystatin C-based eGFR, ambulatory blood pressure parameters, and in-clinic versus ambulatory blood pressure agreement in older community-living adults.</TITLE>The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between chronic kidney disease [CKD; measured using cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] and abnormal ambulatory blood pressure (including nocturnal dipping) in healthy older adults. Further, this study aimed to assess the agreement between clinic and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.|Serum cystatin C levels were measured to calculate eGFR. Participants underwent clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the association between reduced cystatin C-based eGFR (CKDcys) and blood pressure parameters. Bland-Altman analysis was carried out to evaluate the agreement between clinic and ambulatory measurements.|The average age was 72 years. There were 60 individuals with CKDcys (eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m). Compared with those without CKDcys, individuals with CKDcys were older, more likely to have hypertension, and less likely to have normal dipping patterns. On multivariate analysis, the presence of CKDcys was found to be significantly associated with a lower mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (-2 mmHg, P=0.048), but not with nocturnal dipping or other blood pressure parameters. Clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly overestimated the mean wake-time ambulatory SBP; the mean difference was 11 mmHg for those without CKDcys (95% limits of agreement -14 to 35 mmHg) and 14 mmHg for those with CKDcys (95% limits of agreement -13 to 41 mmHg); there was no statistically significant effect modification by CKD status.|In older, seemingly healthy adults, mild CKD was associated with lower ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. The presence of CKD did not affect interpretation of clinic versus ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, although the accuracy of clinic SBP was poor.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

26783522	<TITLE>Molecular Detection of Theileria spp. in Livestock on Five Caribbean Islands.</TITLE>Theileria spp. are tick-transmitted, intracellular apicomplexan protozoan parasites infecting a wide range of animals. As there is very limited information on the prevalence of Theileria spp. in the Caribbean we used the recently described genus-specific pan-Theileria FRET-qPCR to identify infected animals in the region and a standard 18S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing to determine the species involved. We found Theileria spp. in 9% of the convenience samples of animals (n = 752) studied from five Caribbean islands. Donkeys (20.0%: 5/25) were most commonly infected, followed by sheep (17.4%, 25/144), cattle (6.8%; 22/325), goats (5.0%; 12/238), and horses (5.0%; 1/20). Six species of Theileria were identified: T. equi (donkeys, cattle, goats, and sheep), Theileria sp. OT3 (sheep and goats), Theileria sp. NG-2013a (cattle), Theileria sp. YW-2014 (donkeys), Theileria sp. B15a (goats), and Babesia vulpes or a closely related organism (sheep and goats). Only T. equi has been previously reported in the Caribbean. Our findings expand the known host ranges of Theileria spp. and the known distribution of the organisms around the world.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

26796965	<TITLE>Understanding the Complexity of Epigenetic Target Space.</TITLE>The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the complexity of the epigenetic target space. Chemical modifications of histones and nucleic acids constitute a key epigenetic mechanism. Whereas modifications such as methylation and acetylation are well-known, there are many additional, less explored modifications described here. The writers, readers and erasers of such diverse modifications, which constitute a major portion of the potential epigenetic target space, are discussed, in addition to the various other protein families that do not fall under these three categories. Finally, disease relevance and druggability of epigenetic targets are discussed with concluding remarks about the richness and diversity they will provide for future targeted therapies.

26826284	<TITLE>Harnessing the knowledge of animal toxins to generate drugs.</TITLE>Animal toxins present high selectivity and specificity for their molecular targets, and have long been considered as prototypes for developing novel drugs, with some successful cases. In this regard, the variety of molecules found in animal venoms, which can be capable of affecting vital physiological systems, have providing the development of studies focusing on turning those molecules (toxins) into therapeutics to treat several diseases, such as chronic pain, hypertension, thrombosis, cancer, and so on. However, some important issues have been responsible for disrupting the toxin-based drug discovery projects. In this review, we have briefly highlighted the development of drugs based on animal toxins, discussing some successful cases as well as the main causes of failure, pointing out the recent strategies applied to overcome the difficulties related to the translational process in this kind of development scenario.

26839500	<TITLE>Four New Species of Amanita in Inje County, Korea.</TITLE>Amanita (Agaricales, Basidiomycota) is one of the most well-known genera composed of poisonous mushrooms. This genus of almost 500 species is distributed worldwide. Approximately 240 macrofungi were collected through an ongoing survey of indigenous fungi of Mt. Jeombong in Inje County, Korea in 2014. Among these specimens, 25 were identified as members of Amanita using macroscopic features. Specimens were identified to the species level by microscopic features and molecular sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA. We molecularly identified 13 Amanita species, with seven species matching previously recorded species, four species (A. caesareoides, A. griseoturcosa, A. imazekii, and A. sepiacea) new to Korea, and two unknown species.

26842267	<TITLE>Open access resources for genome-wide association mapping in rice.</TITLE>Increasing food production is essential to meet the demands of a growing human population, with its rising income levels and nutritional expectations. To address the demand, plant breeders seek new sources of genetic variation to enhance the productivity, sustainability and resilience of crop varieties. Here we launch a high-resolution, open-access research platform to facilitate genome-wide association mapping in rice, a staple food crop. The platform provides an immortal collection of diverse germplasm, a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism data set tailored for gene discovery, well-documented analytical strategies, and a suite of bioinformatics resources to facilitate biological interpretation. Using grain length, we demonstrate the power and resolution of our new high-density rice array, the accompanying genotypic data set, and an expanded diversity panel for detecting major and minor effect QTLs and subpopulation-specific alleles, with immediate implications for rice improvement.

26845449	<TITLE>Tumor microenvironment and therapeutic response.</TITLE>The tumor microenvironment significantly influences therapeutic response and clinical outcome. Microenvironment-mediated drug resistance can be induced by soluble factors secreted by tumor or stromal cells. The adhesion of tumor cells to stromal fibroblasts or to components of the extracellular matrix can also blunt therapeutic response. Microenvironment-targeted therapy strategies include inhibition of the extracellular ligand-receptor interactions and downstream pathways. Immune cells can both improve and obstruct therapeutic efficacy and may vary in their activation status within the tumor microenvironment; thus, re-programme of the immune response would be substantially more beneficial. The development of rational drug combinations that can simultaneously target tumor cells and the microenvironment may represent a solution to overcome therapeutic resistance.

26858812	<TITLE>Enhancement of microfluidic particle separation using cross-flow filters with hydrodynamic focusing.</TITLE>A microfluidic chip is proposed to separate microparticles using cross-flow filtration enhanced with hydrodynamic focusing. By exploiting a buffer flow from the side, the microparticles in the sample flow are pushed on one side of the microchannels, lining up to pass through the filters. Meanwhile a larger pressure gradient in the filters is obtained to enhance separation efficiency. Compared with the traditional cross-flow filtration, our proposed mechanism has the buffer flow to create a moving virtual boundary for the sample flow to actively push all the particles to reach the filters for separation. It further allows higher flow rates. The device only requires soft lithograph fabrication to create microchannels and a novel pressurized bonding technique to make high-aspect-ratio filtration structures. A mixture of polystyrene microparticles with 2.7 μm and 10.6 μm diameters are successfully separated. 96.2 ± 2.8% of the large particle are recovered with a purity of 97.9 ± 0.5%, while 97.5 ± 0.4% of the small particle are depleted with a purity of 99.2 ± 0.4% at a sample throughput of 10 μl/min. The experiment is also conducted to show the feasibility of this mechanism to separate biological cells with the sample solutions of spiked PC3 cells in whole blood. By virtue of its high separation efficiency, our device offers a label-free separation technique and potential integration with other components, thereby serving as a promising tool for continuous cell filtration and analysis applications.

26858837	<TITLE>Fluconazole in the treatment of Cushing's disease.</TITLE>Ketoconazole was a first-line agent for suppressing steroidogenesis in Cushing's disease. It now has limited availability. Fluconazole, another azole antifungal, is an alternative, although its in vivo efficacy is unclear. A 61-year-old female presented with weight gain, abdominal striae and worsening depression. HbA1c increased to 76 mmol/mol despite increasing insulin. Investigations confirmed cortisol excess; afternoon serum cortisol was 552 nmol/l with an inappropriate ACTH of 9.3 pmol/l. In total, 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC):creatinine ratio was 150 nmol/mmol with failure to suppress after 48 h of low-dose dexamethasone. Pituitary MRI revealed a 4-mm microadenoma. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling confirmed Cushing's disease. Transsphenoidal resection was performed and symptoms improved. However, disease recurred 6 months later with elevated 24-h UFC >2200 nmol/day. Metyrapone was commenced at 750 mg tds. Ketoconazole was later added at 400 mg daily, with dose reduction in metyrapone. When ketoconazole became unavailable, fluconazole 200 mg daily was substituted. Urine cortisol:creatinine ratio rose, and the dose was increased to 400 mg daily with normalisation of urine hormone levels. Serum cortisol and urine cortisol:creatinine ratios remain normal on this regimen at 6 months. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating prolonged in vivo efficacy of fluconazole in combination with low-dose metyrapone for the treatment of Cushing's disease. Fluconazole has a more favourable toxicity profile, and we suggest that it is a potential alternative for medical management of Cushing's disease.|Surgery remains first line for the management of Cushing's disease with pharmacotherapy used where surgery is unsuccessful or there is persistence of cortisol excess.Ketoconazole has previously been used to treat cortisol excess through inhibition of CYP450 enzymes 11-β-hydroxylase and 17-α-hydroxylase, though its availability is limited in many countries.Fluconazole shares similar properties to ketoconazole, although it has less associated toxicity.Fluconazole represents a suitable alternative for the medical management of Cushing's disease and proved an effective addition to metyrapone in the management of this case.

26944858	<TITLE>ICA-derived cortical responses indexing rapid multi-feature auditory processing in six-month-old infants.</TITLE>The abilities of infants to perceive basic acoustic differences, essential for language development, can be studied using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). However, scalp-channel averaged ERPs sum volume-conducted contributions from many cortical areas, reducing the functional specificity and interpretability of channel-based ERP measures. This study represents the first attempt to investigate rapid auditory processing in infancy using independent component analysis (ICA), allowing exploration of source-resolved ERP dynamics and identification of ERP cortical generators. Here, we recorded 60-channel EEG data in 34 typically developing 6-month-old infants during a passive acoustic oddball paradigm presenting 'standard' tones interspersed with frequency- or duration-deviant tones. ICA decomposition was applied to single-subject EEG data. The best-fitting equivalent dipole or bilaterally symmetric dipole pair was then estimated for each resulting independent component (IC) process using a four-layer infant head model. Similar brain-source ICs were clustered across subjects. Results showed ERP contributions from auditory cortex and multiple extra-auditory cortical areas (often, bilaterally paired). Different cortical source combinations contributed to the frequency- and duration-deviant ERP peak sequences. For ICs in an ERP-dominant source cluster located in or near the mid-cingulate cortex, source-resolved frequency-deviant response N2 latency and P3 amplitude at 6 months-of-age predicted vocabulary size at 20 months-of-age. The same measures for scalp channel F6 (though not for other frontal channels) showed similar but weaker correlations. These results demonstrate the significant potential of ICA analyses to facilitate a deeper understanding of the neural substrates of infant sensory processing.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27013054	<TITLE>Structural basis for inhibition of the deadenylase activity of human CNOT6L.</TITLE>Human CNOT6L/CCR4, a member of the endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family enzymes, is one of the two deadenylase enzymes in the conserved CCR4-NOT complex. Here, we report inhibitor-bound crystal structures of the human CNOT6L nuclease domain in complex with the nucleotide CMP and the aminoglycoside neomycin. Deadenylase activity assays show that nucleotides are effective inhibitors of both CNOT6L and CNOT7, with AMP more effective than other nucleotides, and that neomycin is a weak deadenylase inhibitor. Structural analysis shows that all inhibitors occupy the substrate and magnesium-binding sites of CNOT6L, suggesting that inhibitors compete with both substrate and divalent magnesium ions for overlapping binding sites.

27034917	<TITLE>Oxidative stress under ambient and physiological oxygen tension in tissue culture.</TITLE>Oxygen (O2) levels range from 2-9% in vivo. However, cell culture experiments are performed at atmospheric O2 levels (21%). Oxidative stress due to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells cultured at higher than physiological levels is implicated in multitude of deleterious effects including DNA damage, genomic instability and senescence. In addition, oxidative stress activates redox sensitive transcription factors related to inflammatory signaling and apoptotic signaling. Furthermore, several chromatin-modifying enzymes are affected by ROS, potentially impacting epigenetic regulation of gene expression. While primary cells are cultured at lower O2 levels due to their inability to grow at higher O2, the immortalized cells, which display no such apparent growth difficulties, are typically cultured at 21% O2. This review will provide an overview of issues associated with increased oxygen levels in in vitro cell culture and point out the benefits of using lower levels of oxygen tension even for immortalized cells.

27049734	<TITLE>Chemical and semisynthetic approaches to study and target deubiquitinases.</TITLE>Ubiquitination is a key posttranslational modification, which affects numerous biological processes and is reversed by a class of enzymes known as deubiquitinases (DUBs). This family of enzymes cleaves mono-ubiquitin or poly-ubiquitin chains from a target protein through different mechanisms and mode of interactions with their substrates. Studying the role of DUBs in health and diseases has been a major goal for many laboratories both in academia and in industry. However, the field has been challenged by the difficulties in obtaining native substrates and novel reagents using traditional enzymatic and molecular biology approaches. Recent advancements in the synthesis and semisynthesis of proteins made it possible to prepare several unique ubiquitin conjugates to study various aspects of DUBs such as their specificities and structures. Moreover, these approaches enable the preparation of novel activity based probes and assays to monitor DUB activities in vitro and in cellular contexts. Efforts made to bring new chemical entities for the selective inhibition of DUBs based on these tools are also highlighted with selected examples.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

CGG repeat length was determined by PCR, and AR was determined using a newly developed commercial methylation PCR assay and was compared with the results from Southern blot with densitometric image analysis.|Sister 1 had the largest CGG expansion (82) and the lowest AR (12%), with the most severe clinical presentation. Sister 2 had a lower CGG expansion (70) and an AR of 10% but had a milder clinical presentation.Sister 3 had a similar CGG expansion (79) but a slightly higher AR of 15% and less neurologic involvement. Sister 4 had a similar CGG expansion size of 80 but had the largest AR (40%) and was the only sister not to be affected by FXTAS or have any neurologic signs on examination.|These results suggest that premutation carrier women who have higher ARs may be less likely to show manifestations of FXTAS. If larger studies show similar patterns, AR data could potentially be beneficial to supplement CGG repeat size when counseling premutation carrier women in the clinic.

27075778	<TITLE>A Fluorescence Approach to Assess the Production of Soluble Microbial Products from Aerobic Granular Sludge Under the Stress of 2,4-Dichlorophenol.</TITLE>In this study, a fluorescence approach was used to evaluate the production of soluble microbial products (SMP) in aerobic granular sludge system under the stress of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). A combined use of three-dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM), Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), synchronous fluorescence and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) were explored to respect the SMP formation in the exposure of different doses of 2,4-DCP. Data implied that the presence of 2,4-DCP had an obvious inhibition on biological nitrogen removal. According to EEM-PARAFAC, two fluorescent components were derived and represented to the presence of fulvic-like substances and humic-like substances in Component 1 and protein-like substances in Component 2. It was found from synchronous fluorescence that protein-like peak presented slightly higher intensity than that of fulvic-like peak. 2D-COS further revealed that fluorescence change took place sequentially in the following order: protein-like fraction > fulvic-like fraction. The obtained results could provide a potential application of fluorescence spectra in the released SMP assessment in the exposure of toxic compound during wastewater treatment.

27107978	<TITLE>Atomic force microscopy indentation and inverse analysis for non-linear viscoelastic identification of breast cancer cells.</TITLE>Breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MCF-10A) are studied through indentation with spherical borosilicate glass particles in atomic force microscopy (AFM) contact mode in fluid. Their mechanical properties are obtained by analyzing the recorded reaction force-time response. The analysis is based on comparing experimental data with predictions from finite element (FE) simulation. Here, FE modeling is employed to simulate the AFM indentation experiment which is neither a displacement nor a force controlled test. This approach is expected to overcome many underlying problems of the widely used models such as Hertz contact model due to its capability to capture the contact behaviors between the spherical indentor and the cell, account for cell geometry, and incorporate with large strain theory. In this work, a non-linear viscoelastic (NLV) model in which the viscoelastic part is described by Prony series terms is used for the constitutive model of the cells. The time-dependent material parameters are extracted through an inverse analysis with the use of a surrogate model based on a Kriging estimator. The purpose is to automatically extract the NLV properties of the cells with a more efficient process compared to the iterative inverse technique that has been mostly applied in the literature. The method also allows the use of FE modeling in the analysis of a large amount of experimental data. The NLV parameters are compared between MCF-7 and MCF-10A and MCF-10A treated and untreated with the drug Cytochalasin D to examine the possibility of using relaxation properties as biomarkers for distinguishing these types of breast cancer cells. The comparisons indicate that malignant cells (MCF-7) are softer and exhibit more relaxation than benign cells (MCF-10A). Disrupting the cytoskeleton using the drug Cytochalasin D also results in a larger amount of relaxation in the cell's response. In addition, relaxation properties indicate larger differences as compared to the elastic moduli like instantaneous shear modulus. These results may be useful for disease diagnosing purposes.

27120584	<TITLE>Novel cationic coating agent for protein separation by capillary electrophoresis(†).</TITLE>A novel positively charged surfactant N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-(1,2-propandiol) ammonium chloride was used for the dynamic coating of the inner wall of a silica capillary. This paper covers the evaluation of dynamic coating and study of the influence of the analysis conditions for the magnitude and direction of electroosmotic flow as well as for the effective and selective separation of chosen proteins (ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin). The concentration of 0.1 mM of N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-(1,2-propandiol) ammonium chloride enabled the reversal of the electro-osmotic flow, however, to separate basic as well as neutral proteins the higher concentration of the studied surfactant was necessary. The final conditions for the separation of studied proteins were set at 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 with 10.0 mM of the studied surfactant. The results were also compared with those of two commercially available cationic surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Additionally, the developed method for protein separation was applied for the determination of lysozyme in a cheese sample. The limits of detection and quantification of lysozyme were 0.9 and 3.0 mg/L, respectively. The mean concentration of lysozyme found in the cheese sample was 167.3 ± 10.3 mg/kg.

The EuroQol EQ-5D is a widely used generic preference-based instrument to measure Health-related quality of life.|The objective of this study was to develop a value set of the EQ-5D health states for an Iranian population.|This study is a cross-sectional study of Iranian populations. Our sample from Iranian populations consists out of 869 participants, who were selected for this study using a stratified probability sampling method. The sample was taken from individuals living in the city of Tehran and was stratified by age and gender from July to November 2013. Respondents valued 13 health states using the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D. Several fixed effects regression models were tested to predict the full set of health states. We selected the final model based on the logical consistency of the estimates, the sign and magnitude of the regression coefficients, goodness of fit, and parsimony. We also compared predicted values with a value set from similar studies in the UK and other countries.|Our results show that the HRQoL does not vary among socioeconomic groups. Models at the individual level resulted in an additive model with all coefficients being statistically significant, R(2) = 0.55, a value of 0.75 for the best health state (11112), and a value of -0.074 for the worst health state (33333). The value set obtained for the study sample remarkably differs from those elicited in developed countries.|This study is the first estimate for the EQ-5D value set based on the VAS in Iran. Given the importance of locally adapted value set the use of this value set can be recommended for future studies in Iran and In the EMRO regions.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

27294677	<TITLE>Human Leptospirosis on Reunion Island, Indian Ocean: Are Rodents the (Only) Ones to Blame?</TITLE>Although leptospirosis is a zoonosis of major concern on tropical islands, the molecular epidemiology of the disease aiming at linking human cases to specific animal reservoirs has been rarely explored within these peculiar ecosystems.|Five species of wild small mammals (n = 995) as well as domestic animals (n = 101) were screened for Leptospira infection on Reunion Island; positive samples were subsequently genotyped and compared to Leptospira from clinical cases diagnosed in 2012-2013 (n = 66), using MLST analysis. We identified two pathogenic species in human cases, namely Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira borgpetersenii. Leptospira interrogans was by far dominant both in clinical samples (96.6%) and in infected animal samples (95.8%), with Rattus spp and dogs being its exclusive carriers. The genetic diversity within L. interrogans was apparently limited to two sequence types (STs): ST02, identified among most clinical samples and in all rats with complete MLST, and ST34, identified in six humans, but not in rats. Noteworthy, L. interrogans detected in two stray dogs partially matched with ST02 and ST34. Leptospira borgpetersenii was identified in two clinical samples only (3.4%), as well as in cows and mice; four haplotypes were identified, of which two seemingly identical in clinical and animal samples. Leptospira borgpetersenii haplotypes detected in human cases were clearly distinct from the lineage detected so far in the endemic bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, thus excluding a role for this volant mammal in the local human epidemiology of the disease.|Our data confirm rats as a major reservoir of Leptospira on Reunion Island, but also pinpoint a possible role of dogs, cows and mice in the local epidemiology of human leptospirosis. This study shows that a comprehensive molecular characterization of pathogenic Leptospira in both clinical and animal samples helps to gaining insight into leptospirosis epidemiology within a specific environmental setting.

The plants were extracted with 30-70% aqueous-methanol and n-hexane. The antimicrobial activities were examined using agar well diffusion method against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) and fungi (Candidaalbicans). Results showed that E. coli were more sensitive than Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The largest zone of inhibition (52 mm) was recorded against E. coli with the n-hexane extract of Kalanchoe laciniata.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27457933	<TITLE>Controlled fire use in early humans might have triggered the evolutionary emergence of tuberculosis.</TITLE>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), a wildly successful group of organisms and the leading cause of death resulting from a single bacterial pathogen worldwide. It is generally accepted that MTBC established itself in human populations in Africa and that animal-infecting strains diverged from human strains. However, the precise causal factors of TB emergence remain unknown. Here, we propose that the advent of controlled fire use in early humans created the ideal conditions for the emergence of TB as a transmissible disease. This hypothesis is supported by mathematical modeling together with a synthesis of evidence from epidemiology, evolutionary genetics, and paleoanthropology.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27483300	<TITLE>Prevalence and Risk Factors of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Population-Based Study in Northeast China.</TITLE>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has attracted increasing attention worldwide. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of HFpEF and analyze its correlates in a sample of residents of northeast China;|A population-based study of 2230 participants ≥35 years old was conducted in rural areas of Liaoning Province from January 2012 through August 2013. Information about lifestyle and other potential risk factors was obtained. HFpEF was diagnosed according to the recommendations of European Society of Cardiology;|The overall prevalence of HFpEF was 3.5% (1.8% in men and 4.9% in women). The prevalence of HFpEF increased with age in both genders and was greater in women than in men for every age group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that female gender (OR, 3.575; 95% CI, 1.761-7.256), hypertension (OR, 3.711; 95% CI, 2.064-6.674), and history of heart disease (2.086; 95% CI, 1.243-3.498) were associated factors for prevalent HFpEF;|In a general population from rural northeast China, we found that female gender, hypertension, and history of heart disease were risk factors for prevalent HFpEF.

27561909	<TITLE>Selective Versus Non-selective α-Blockade Prior to Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy for Pheochromocytoma.</TITLE>The optimal preoperative α-blockade strategy is debated for patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas. We evaluated the impact of selective versus non-selective α-blockade on intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes.|We identified patients having laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas from 2001 to 2015. As a marker of overall intraoperative hemodynamics, we combined systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 200, SBP < 80, SBP < 80 and >200, pulse > 120, vasopressor infusion, and vasodilator infusion into a single variable. Similarly, the combination of vasopressor infusion in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission provided an overview of postoperative support.|We identified 52 patients undergoing unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. Selective α-blockade (i.e. doxazosin) was performed in 35 % (n = 18) of patients, and non-selective blockade with phenoxybenzamine was performed in 65 % (n = 34) of patients. Demographics and tumor characteristics were similar between groups. Patients blocked selectively were more likely to have an SBP < 80 (67 %) than those blocked with phenoxybenzamine (35 %) (p = 0.03), but we found no significant difference in overall intraoperative hemodynamics between patients blocked selectively and non-selectively (p = 0.09). However, postoperatively, patients blocked selectively were more likely to require additional support with vasopressor infusions in the PACU or ICU admission (p = 0.02). Hospital stay and complication rates were similar.|Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma is safe regardless of the preoperative α-blockade strategy employed, but patients blocked selectively may have a higher incidence of transient hypotension during surgery and a greater need for postoperative support. These differences did not result in longer hospital stay or increased complications.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27592410	<TITLE>Temporal limits on rubber hand illusion reflect individuals' temporal resolution in multisensory perception.</TITLE>Synchronous, but not asynchronous, multisensory stimulation has been successfully employed to manipulate the experience of body ownership, as in the case of the rubber hand illusion. Hence, it has been assumed that the rubber hand illusion is bound by the same temporal rules as in multisensory integration. However, empirical evidence of a direct link between the temporal limits on the rubber hand illusion and those on multisensory integration is still lacking. Here we provide the first comprehensive evidence that individual susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion depends upon the individual temporal resolution in multisensory perception, as indexed by the temporal binding window. In particular, in two studies we showed that the degree of temporal asynchrony necessary to prevent the induction of the rubber hand illusion depends upon the individuals' sensitivity to perceiving asynchrony during visuo-tactile stimulation. That is, the larger the temporal binding window, as inferred from a simultaneity judgment task, the higher the level of asynchrony tolerated in the rubber hand illusion. Our results suggest that current neurocognitive models of body ownership can be enriched with a temporal dimension. Moreover, our results suggest that the different aspects of body ownership operate over different time scales.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27604364	<TITLE>What is the value of the SAGES/AORN MIS checklist? A multi-institutional practical assessment.</TITLE>Surgical safety checklists reduce perioperative complications and mortality. Given that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is dependent on technology and vulnerable to equipment failure, SAGES and AORN partnered to create a MIS checklist to optimize case flow and minimize errors. The aim of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAGES/AORN checklist in preventing disruptions and determine its ease of use.|The checklist was implemented across four institutions and completed by the operating team. To assess its effectiveness, we recorded how often the checklist identified problems and how frequently each of the 45 checklist items were not completed. The perceived usefulness, ease of use, and frustration associated with checklist use were rated on a 5-point Likert scale by the surgeon. We assessed any differences dependent on timing of checklist completion and among institutions.|The checklist was performed during MIS procedures (n = 114). When used before the procedure (n = 36), the checklist identified missing items in 13 cases (36.11 %). When used after the procedure (n = 61), the checklist identified missing items in 18 cases (29.51 %) that caused a delay of 4.1 ± 11.1 min. The most frequently missed items included preference card review (14.0 %), readiness of the carbon dioxide insufflator (8.7 %), and availability of the Veress needle (3.6 %). The checklist took an average of 3.6 ± 2.7 min to complete with its usefulness rated 2.6 ± 1.5, ease of use 2.0 ± 1.2, and frustration 1.3 ± 1.1.|The checklist identified problems in 24 % of cases that led to preventable delays. The checklist was easy to complete and not frustrating, indicating it could improve operative flow. This study also identified the most useful items which may help abbreviate the checklist, minimizing the frustration and time taken to complete it while maximizing its utility. These attributes of the SAGES/AORN MIS checklist should be explored in future larger-scale studies.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27678417	<TITLE>Immunostaining of proinflammatory cytokines in renal cortex and medulla of rats exposed to gold nanoparticles.</TITLE>Recently, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have shown promising applications in targeted drug delivery and contrast imaging. Although in vitro cytotoxicity of GNPs has been thoroughly studied, there are limited data on in vivo toxicity of GNPs. In this study, we evaluated the effects of intraperitoneally injected 10 nm and 50 nm GNPs (5 μg/animal) on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) on day 1 and day 5, post-exposure. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that both 10 nm and 50 nm GNPs induced an acute phase expression of proinflammatory cytokines in renal cortex and medulla. This proinflammatory response was comparatively more intense in renal medulla than cortex. All the three cytokines were undetectable in control cortex and medulla. In conclusion, both 10 nm and 50 nm GNPs caused an acute phase induction of proinflammatory cytokines in cortex and medulla of rat kidneys. An intense immunostaining of proinflammatory cytokines in renal medulla warrants further studies to evaluate the nephrotoxicity of GNPs to validate the safe application of GNPs for contrast imaging in renal insufficiency.

27686237	<TITLE>Emotional Intelligence and Personality Traits as Predictors of Occupational Therapy students' Practice Education Performance: A Cross-Sectional Study.</TITLE>This study investigated whether occupational therapy students' emotional intelligence and personality traits are predictive of specific aspects of their fieldwork performance. A total of 114 second and third year undergraduate occupational therapy students (86.6% response rate) completed the Genos Emotional Intelligence Inventory (Genos EI) and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). Fieldwork performance scores were obtained from the Student Practice Evaluation Form Revised (SPEF-R). Linear regressions were completed with the SPEF-R domains being the dependent variables and the Genos EI and TIPI factors being the independent variables. Regression analysis results revealed that the Genos EI subscales of Emotional Management of Others (EMO), Emotional Awareness of Others (EAO), Emotional Expression (EEX) and Emotional Reasoning (ERE) were significant predictors of various domains of students' fieldwork performance. EAO and ERE were significant predictors of students' Communication Skills accounting for 4.6% of its variance. EMO, EAO, EEX and ERE were significant predictors of students' Documentation Skills explaining 6.8% of its variance. EMO was a significant predictor of students' Professional Behaviour accounting for 3.2% of its variance. No TIPI factors were found to be significant predictors of the SPEF-R domains. Occupational therapy students' emotional intelligence was a significant predictor of components of their fieldwork performance while students' personality traits were not. The convenience sampling approach used, small sample size recruited and potential issue of social desirability of the self-reported Genos EI and TIPI data are acknowledged as study limitations. It is recommended that other studies be completed to investigate if any other relevant constructs or factors are predictive of occupational therapy students' fieldwork performance.

27737363	<TITLE>Black stains and dental caries in Brazilian schoolchildren: a cross-sectional study.</TITLE>The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of black stains (BS) and factors associated with their occurrence and to investigate the association of BS with caries experience after adjusting for other risk indicators. A school-based, cross-sectional study using multistage sampling of children aged 10-12 years from 20 private and public schools in Pelotas/Southern Brazil was conducted (n = 706). Children were evaluated for BS and dental caries (DMFT/dmft index) and socioeconomic information was collected by questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate Poisson regressions were used to assess variables associated with the prevalence of BS and with caries experience. The prevalence of BS was 5.81%. The mean DMFT/dmft was 1.54 (±1.91), with a maximum value of 10. Among the children with BS, mean dmft/DMFT was 1.22 (SD 1.68), with a maximum value of 6. After adjustments for demographics and socioeconomic variables, dental plaque and tooth brushing habits, prevalence of BS was associated with lower caries experience (RR 0.67; 95%CI 0.49-0.92). In conclusion, the presence of BS showed an association with lower dental caries experience in the evaluated population. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms behind this association.

27742680	<TITLE>Disentangling the Taxonomy of Rickettsiales and Description of Two Novel Symbionts ("Candidatus Bealeia paramacronuclearis" and "Candidatus Fokinia cryptica") Sharing the Cytoplasm of the Ciliate Protist Paramecium biaurelia.</TITLE>In the past 10 years, the number of endosymbionts described within the bacterial order Rickettsiales has constantly grown. Since 2006, 18 novel Rickettsiales genera inhabiting protists, such as ciliates and amoebae, have been described. In this work, we characterize two novel bacterial endosymbionts from Paramecium collected near Bloomington, IN. Both endosymbiotic species inhabit the cytoplasm of the same host. The Gram-negative bacterium "Candidatus Bealeia paramacronuclearis" occurs in clumps and is frequently associated with the host macronucleus. With its electron-dense cytoplasm and a distinct halo surrounding the cell, it is easily distinguishable from the second smaller symbiont, "Candidatus Fokinia cryptica," whose cytoplasm is electron lucid, lacks a halo, and is always surrounded by a symbiontophorous vacuole. For molecular characterization, the small-subunit rRNA genes were sequenced and used for taxonomic assignment as well as the design of species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that "Candidatus Bealeia paramacronuclearis" clusters with the so-called "basal" Rickettsiales, and "Candidatus Fokinia cryptica" belongs to "Candidatus Midichloriaceae." We obtained tree topologies showing a separation of Rickettsiales into at least two groups: one represented by the families Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, and "Candidatus Midichloriaceae" (RAM clade), and the other represented by "basal Rickettsiales," including "Candidatus Bealeia paramacronuclearis." Therefore, and in accordance with recent publications, we propose to limit the order Rickettsiales to the RAM clade and to raise "basal Rickettsiales" to an independent order, Holosporales ord. nov., inside Alphaproteobacteria, which presently includes four family-level clades. Additionally, we define the family "Candidatus Hepatincolaceae" and redefine the family Holosporaceae IMPORTANCE: In this paper, we provide the characterization of two novel bacterial symbionts inhabiting the same Paramecium host (Ciliophora, Alveolata). Both symbionts belong to "traditional" Rickettsiales, one representing a new species of the genus "Candidatus Fokinia" ("Candidatus Midichloriaceae"), and the other representing a new genus of a "basal" Rickettsiales According to newly characterized sequences and to a critical revision of recent literature, we propose a taxonomic reorganization of "traditional" Rickettsiales that we split into two orders: Rickettsiales sensu stricto and Holosporales ord. nov. This work represents a critical revision, including new records of a group of symbionts frequently occurring in protists and whose biodiversity is still largely underestimated.

27762480	<TITLE>Variation in resource utilization in liver transplantation at freestanding children's hospitals.</TITLE>We sought to examine the relationship between liver transplant-related total cost, patient outcome, and hospital resource utilization at freestanding children's hospitals. Using the PHIS database, a retrospective study of 374 patients that underwent liver transplantation at 15 freestanding children's hospitals from July 2010 to December 2012 was performed. One-year graft failure and patient mortality rates from July 2010 to December 2012 for each center were also obtained from the SRTR. There was a 5.1-fold difference in median cost (median $146 444, range $59 487-302 058, P<.001) between all centers. A 2.4-fold difference existed in median LOS (median 15 days, range 9-22 days, P<.001) across centers. Median postoperative ICU stay varied from 0 to 7 days (median 4 days, P<.001). Overall, 30-day readmission rate was 55% (31.3%-100%, P<.001). One-year graft failure varied from 0% to 19.1%, with an overall rate of 5.5% (P=.279). One-year patient mortality for all centers was 2.3% (range 0%-11.1%, P=.016). Higher total cost did not correlate with lower readmission rates, patient mortality, graft failure, or any other variable. These data suggest that identifying practice patterns at low-cost centers and implementing them at higher-cost centers may decrease the cost of pediatric liver transplantation without compromising outcomes.

27769319	<TITLE>Canadian ophthalmic microsurgery course: an innovative spin on wet lab-based surgical education.</TITLE>Wet lab and surgical simulation can reduce the learning curve of difficult surgical techniques, accelerate the rate for trainees to achieve surgical competency, and improve patient safety. To provide the most up-to-date information and hands-on experiences with novel ophthalmic surgical techniques and instruments, the Department of Ophthalmology at Western University has created a wet lab-based, multilevel microsurgery skills transfer course through collaboration with various industry partners. Several elements in the course goal and design differentiate this type of surgical course from typical wet labs: the format is multileveled surgical training, with a beginner level targeting undergraduate medical students, an intermediate level for ophthalmology residents, and an advanced level for trained ophthalmologist. In addition, the level of industry participation allows the development of true partnership and offers a method to introduce awareness and innovation in a cost-effective manner. This article presents the organization, course setup, and feedback from the pilot course.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27808555	<TITLE>Randomized open-label trial of baclofen for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence.</TITLE>Alcohol dependence is a progressive chronic disorder characterized by narrowing of the drinking repertoire, salience of drinking, tolerance and withdrawal phenomenon, compulsion to drink, and frequent relapses. Baclofen has been shown to promote abstinence, to reduce craving, and to reduce anxiety in alcohol-dependent individuals, and it promises to be a useful agent, although clinical data are limited at present.|The current study aimed to test the utility of baclofen, a GABA agonist, in improving the relapse rates in alcohol-dependent subjects.|A total of 122 alcohol-dependent subjects were randomized into two groups. Groups were administered baclofen (30 mg/day) or benfothiamine (a nutritional supplement) using an open label design. Both groups received brief motivational intervention. Subjects were assessed at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks for the primary outcome measures: time to first relapse, heavy drinking days, cumulative abstinence duration, and craving (measured by the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)).|Seventy-two participants received baclofen, and 50 received benfothiamine. Participants receiving baclofen remained abstinent for significantly more days than the benfothiamine group (p < 0.05). The percentage of heavy drinking days was significantly lower in the baclofen group (p = 0.001). Craving and anxiety scores (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) were also significantly decreased in the baclofen group relative to the control group (p = 0.001). Time to first relapse was similar in both groups.|In this open-label trial, alcohol-dependent participants receiving baclofen showed significant improvements in drinking outcomes compared with participants receiving benfothiamine. This study provides further evidence that baclofen is useful for the treatment of alcohol dependence.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
27823985	<TITLE>Dosimetric superiority of flattening filter free beams for single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery in single brain metastasis.</TITLE>For single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using linac in brain metastases, more accurate treatment delivery with higher tumor absorbed doses and lower absorbed doses to normal tissues remains an enormous challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dosimetric superiority in flattening filter free beams (FFF) for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in single brain metastasis. 68 patients with single brain metastasis were included in this study. Every patient was subjected to VMAT treatment plans using 6 MV standard flattened (FF) beams (VMAT_FF) and 6 MV FFF beams (VMAT_FFF) with single fraction doses of 20 Gy. Dosimetric evaluation was performed by analysis of target coverage, dose gradients, beam-on time (BOT), gantry speed and number of monitor units (MU). There were no differences between VMAT_FF and VMAT_FFF plans in conformity and MU. VMAT_FFF plans showed obvious superiority in homogeneity, dose gradients and efficiency. For the mean BOT, VMAT_FFF plans provided a significant decrease by 42.8% compared with VMAT_FF. By the use of FFF beams, brain irradiation was minimized with about 2% reductions in low-dose regions (about 5-10 Gy). FFF beams not only resulted in more efficiency by reducing treatment time, but also provided further brain sparing compared to traditional techniques for SRS in single brain metastasis.

27872332	<TITLE>Estimates of Intraclass Correlation Coefficients and Other Design Parameters for Studies of School-Based Nutritional Interventions.</TITLE>When cluster randomized trials are used to evaluate school-based nutritional interventions such as school lunch programs, design-stage estimates of the required sample size must take into account the correlation in outcomes among individuals within each cluster (e.g., classrooms, schools, or districts). Estimates of the necessary parameters have been carefully developed for educational interventions, but for nutritional interventions the literature is thin.|Using data from two large multi-school, multi-district impact evaluations conducted in the United States, this article calculates estimates of the design parameters required for sizing school-based nutritional studies. The large size of the trials (252 and 1,327 schools) yields precise estimates of the parameters of interest. Variance components are estimated by fitting random-intercept multilevel models in Stata.|School-level intraclass correlations are similar to those typically found for educational outcomes. In particular, school-level estimates range from less than .01 to .26 across the two studies, and district-level estimates ranged from less than .01 to .19. This suggests that cluster randomized trials of nutritional interventions may require samples with numbers of schools similar to the education studies to detect similar effect sizes.

27929277	<TITLE>Acute Monoarthritis: Diagnosis in Adults.</TITLE>Acute monoarthritis can be the initial manifestation of many joint disorders. The most common diagnoses in the primary care setting are osteoarthritis, gout, and trauma. It is important to understand the prevalence of specific etiologies and to use the appropriate diagnostic modalities. A delay in diagnosis and treatment, particularly in septic arthritis, can have catastrophic results including sepsis, bacteremia, joint destruction, or death. The history and physical examination can help guide the use of laboratory and imaging studies. The presence of focal bone pain or recent trauma requires radiography of the affected joint to rule out metabolic bone disease, tumor, or fracture. If there is a joint effusion in the absence of trauma or recent surgery, and signs of infection (e.g., fever, erythema, warmth) are present, subsequent arthrocentesis should be performed. Inflammatory synovial fluid containing monosodium urate crystals indicates a high probability of gout. Noninflammatory synovial fluid suggests osteoarthritis or internal derangement. Pitfalls in the diagnosis and early treatment of acute monoarthritis include failure to perform arthrocentesis, administering antibiotics before aspirating the joint when septic arthritis is suspected (or failing to start antibiotics after aspiration), and starting treatment based solely on laboratory data, such as an elevated uric acid level.

27941359	<TITLE>Short article: Capsule endoscopy in graft-versus-host disease.</TITLE>The gold standard in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is conventional endoscopy with histopathological assessment. The role of capsule endoscopy (CE) is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of CE in this setting, comparing the clinical, endoscopic and histological data.|This was a retrospective single-centre study that included 57 (mean age: 47.18±15.05 years, 57.89% men) patients presenting with GVHD who underwent a valid CE and histopathological analysis by conventional endoscopy between January 2004 and July 2016. The endoscopic scored findings, clinical data and histopathological diagnosis were compared using duodenal histology as the gold standard.|CE detected mild (n=4, 7.02%), moderate (n=6, 10.53%) and severe (n=21, 36.84%) grades, with a higher diagnostic yield than conventional endoscopy (54.39 vs. 28.07%, P<0.001). A positive CE predicted positive histology (80.64 vs. 15.38%, P<0.001) with a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and accuracy of 86.21, 78.57, 84.62 and 82.46%. This procedure detected more mild-to-moderate histological lesions than conventional endoscopy (8.77 vs. 3.51%, P=0.25). In addition, 16% of patients with a previous normal endoscopy with biopsies had a pathological CE and there were eight (25.81%) patients with positive CE images unreachable by conventional endoscopy.|CE is a useful device in GVHD, achieving high accuracy values and diagnostic yield. However, its results may be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and histological features, particularly in mild-to-moderate stages.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28035606	<TITLE>Interaction effects of As, Cd and Pb on their respective bioaccessibility with time in co-contaminated soils assessed by the Unified BARGE Method.</TITLE>Interaction effects of As, Cd and Pb on their respective bioaccessibility in co-contaminated soils were reported. In addition, the influence of aging time (up to 90 days) on potential interactions was also investigated. Experiments were carried out by spiking four diverse soils with single, binary or ternary mixtures of As, Cd and Pb. Soils were measured for bioaccessibility at different aging periods. Results demonstrate that bioaccessibility of As, Cd and Pb reached a steady state after soils were aged for 30 days. Bioaccessibility of As, Cd and Pb in soils spiked with binary mixtures of As, Cd and Pb were not affected by the other co-existing metal/metalloid. But when As, Cd and Pb were introduced together to acidic soils which lacked abundant binding sites, intestinal bioaccessibility of Cd was increased at the early stage of aging (7 to 30 days) whilst bioaccessibility of As and Pb remained unchanged. However, when Pb and As were added after Cd has been incubated in soil for 7 days, Cd intestinal bioaccessibility was not influenced by As and Pb. Therefore, a number of factors should be taken into consideration when estimating the bioaccessibility of mixed As, Cd and Pb, including the loadings of As, Cd and Pb in soils, the time for which they have been aged together and the time period between As, Cd and Pb entering the soils.

28057943	<TITLE>Taxonomic description of in situ bee pollen from the middle Eocene of Germany.</TITLE>The middle Eocene Messel and Eckfeld localities are renowned for their excellently preserved faunas and diverse floras. Here we describe for the first time pollen from insect-pollinated plants found in situ on well-preserved ancient bees using light and scanning electron microscopy. There have been 140 pollen types reported from Messel and 162 pollen types from Eckfeld. Here we document 23 pollen types, six from Messel and 18 from Eckfeld (one is shared). The taxa reported here are all pollinated by insects and mostly not recovered in the previously studied dispersed fossil pollen records. Typically, a single or two pollen types are found on each fossil bee specimen, the maximum number of distinct pollen types on a single individual is five. Only five of the 23 pollen types obtained are angiosperms of unknown affinity, the remainder cover a broad taxonomic range of angiosperm trees and include members of several major clades: monocots (1 pollen type), fabids (7), malvids (4), asterids (5) and other core eudicots (1). Seven types each can be assigned to individual genera or infrafamilial clades. Since bees visit only flowers in the relative vicinity of their habitat, the recovered pollen provides a unique insight into the autochthonous palaeo-flora. The coexistence of taxa such as Decodon, Elaeocarpus, Mortoniodendron and other Tilioideae, Mastixoideae, Olax, Pouteria and Nyssa confirms current views that diverse, thermophilic forests thrived at the Messel and Eckfeld localities, probably under a warm subtropical, fully humid climate. Our study calls for increased attention to pollen found in situ on pollen-harvesting insects such as bees, which can provide new insights on insect-pollinated plants and complement even detailed palaeo-palynological knowledge obtained mostly from pollen of wind-pollinated plants in the dispersed pollen record of sediments. In the case of Elaeocarpus, Mortoniodendron, Olax and Pouteria the pollen collected by the middle Eocene bees represent the earliest unambiguous records of their respective genera.

28076414	<TITLE>A MRI-Compatible Combined Mechanical Loading and MR Elastography Setup to Study Deformation-Induced Skeletal Muscle Damage in Rats.</TITLE>Deformation of skeletal muscle in the proximity of bony structures may lead to deep tissue injury category of pressure ulcers. Changes in mechanical properties have been proposed as a risk factor in the development of deep tissue injury and may be useful as a diagnostic tool for early detection. MRE allows for the estimation of mechanical properties of soft tissue through analysis of shear wave data. The shear waves originate from vibrations induced by an external actuator placed on the tissue surface. In this study a combined Magnetic Resonance (MR) compatible indentation and MR Elastography (MRE) setup is presented to study mechanical properties associated with deep tissue injury in rats. The proposed setup allows for MRE investigations combined with damage-inducing large strain indentation of the Tibialis Anterior muscle in the rat hind leg inside a small animal MR scanner. An alginate cast allowed proper fixation of the animal leg with anatomical perfect fit, provided boundary condition information for FEA and provided good susceptibility matching. MR Elastography data could be recorded for the Tibialis Anterior muscle prior to, during, and after indentation. A decaying shear wave with an average amplitude of approximately 2 μm propagated in the whole muscle. MRE elastograms representing local tissue shear storage modulus Gd showed significant increased mean values due to damage-inducing indentation (from 4.2 ± 0.1 kPa before to 5.1 ± 0.6 kPa after, p<0.05). The proposed setup enables controlled deformation under MRI-guidance, monitoring of the wound development by MRI, and quantification of tissue mechanical properties by MRE. We expect that improved knowledge of changes in soft tissue mechanical properties due to deep tissue injury, will provide new insights in the etiology of deep tissue injuries, skeletal muscle damage and other related muscle pathologies.

28163331	<TITLE>Nutrient and pollutant metals within earthworm residues are immobilized in soil during decomposition.</TITLE>Earthworms are known to bioaccumulate metals, making them a potential vector for metal transport in soils. However, the fate of metals within soil upon death of earthworms has not been characterized. We compared the fate of nutrient (Ca, Mg, Mn) and potentially toxic (Cu, Zn, Pb) metals during decomposition of Amynthas agrestis and Lumbricus rubellus in soil columns. Cumulative leachate pools, exchangeable pools (0.1 M KCl + 0.01 M acetic acid extracted), and stable pools (16 M HNO3 + 12 M HCl extracted) were quantified in the soil columns after 7, 21, and 60 days of decomposition. Soil columns containing A. agrestis and L. rubellus had significantly higher cumulative leachate pools of Ca, Mn, Cu, and Pb than Control soil columns. Exchangeable and stable pools of Cu, Pb, and Zn were greater for A. agrestis and L. rubellus soil columns than Control soil columns. However, we estimated that > 98 % of metals from earthworm residues were immobilized in the soil in an exchangeable or stable form over the 60 days using a mass balance approach. Micro-XRF images of longitudinal thin sections of soil columns after 60 days containing A. agrestis confirm metals immobilization in earthworm residues. Our research demonstrates that nutrient and toxic metals are stabilized in soil within earthworm residues.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28168075	<TITLE>Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Presenting as a Paranasal Sinus Mass: The Importance of Differential Diagnosis.</TITLE>Metastases in the paranasal sinuses are rare; renal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer that metastasizes to this region. We present the case of a patient with a 4-month history of a rapidly growing mass of the nasal pyramid following a nasal trauma, associated with spontaneous epistaxis and multiple episodes of hematuria. Cranial CT scan and MRI showed an ethmoid mass extending to the choanal region, the right orbit, and the right frontal sinus with an initial intracranial extension. Patient underwent surgery with a trans-sinusal frontal approach using a bicoronal incision combined with an anterior midfacial degloving; histological exam was compatible with a metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Following histological findings, a total body CT scan showed a solitary 6 cm mass in the upper posterior pole of the left kidney identified as the primary tumor. Although rare, metastatic renal cell carcinoma should always be suspected in patients with nasal or paranasal masses, especially if associated with symptoms suggestive of a systemic involvement such as hematuria. A correct early-stage diagnosis of metastatic RCC can considerably improve survival rate in these patients; preoperative differential diagnosis with contrast-enhanced imaging is fundamental for the correct treatment and follow-up strategy.

28193190	<TITLE>Enhanced expression of Vastatin inhibits angiogenesis and prolongs survival in murine orthotopic glioblastoma model.</TITLE>Antiangiogenic therapies are considered promising for the treatment of glioblastoma (GB). The non-collagenous C-terminal globular NC1 domain of type VIII collagen a1 chain, Vastatin, is an endogenous antiangiogenic polypeptide. Sustained enhanced expression of Vastatin was shown to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis in murine hepatocellular carcinoma models. In this study, we further explored the efficacy of Vastatin in the treatment of GB xenografts.|Treatment of Vastatin was carried out using a nanopolymer gene vector PEI600-CyD-Folate (H1). Antiangiogenic effect of Vastatin was tested in vitro by using co-culture system and conditioned medium. An orthotopic GB murine model was established to examine the in vivo therapeutic effect of Vastatin alone treatment and its combination with temozolomide.|Vastatin gene transfection mediated by H1 could target tumour cells specifically and suppress the proliferation of microvessel endothelial cells (MECs) through a paracrine inhibition manner. Enhancing Vastatin expression by intracerebral injection of H1-Vastatin significantly prolonged animal survival from 48 to 75 days in GB murine model, which was comparable to the effect of Endostatin, the most studied endogenous antiangiogenic polypeptide. The diminished presence of CD34 positive cells in the GB xenografts suggested that Vastatin induced significant antiangiogenesis. Moreover, a synergistic effect in extending survival was detected when H1-Vastatin was administered with temozolomide (TMZ) in GB chemoresistant murine models.|Our results suggest, for the first time, that Vastatin is an antiangiogenic polypeptide with significant potential therapeutic benefit for GB. H1-Vastatin gene therapy may have important implications in re-sensitizing recurrent GB to standard chemotherapeutic agents.	Activation of VASTATIN ameliorated a glioblastoma disease model
28228854	<TITLE>A postsynthetically 2'-"clickable" uridine with arabino configuration and its application for fluorescent labeling and imaging of DNA.</TITLE>The arabino-configured analog of uridine with a propargyl group at the 2'-position was synthesized and incorporated into DNA by solid-phase chemistry. The fluorescence quantum yields of DNA strands that were postsynthetically modified by blue and green emitting cyanine-styryl dyes were improved due to the arabino-configured anchor. These oligonucleotides were used as energy transfer donors in hybrids with oligonucleotides modified with acceptor dyes that emit in the yellow-red range. These combinations give energy transfer pairs with blue-yellow, blue-red and green-red emission color changes. All combinations of arabino- and ribo-configured donor strands with arabino- and ribo-configured acceptor strands were evaluated. This array of doubly modified hybrids was screened by their emission color contrast and fluorescence quantum yield. Especially mixed combinations, that means donor dyes with arabino-configured anchor with acceptor dyes with ribo-configured anchor, and vice versa, showed significantly improved fluorescence properties. Those were successfully applied for fluorescent imaging of DNA after transport into living cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28232744	<TITLE>The T-ALL related gene BCL11B regulates the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation.</TITLE>The initial stages of T-cell differentiation are characterized by a progressive commitment to the T-cell lineage, a process that involves the loss of alternative (myelo-erythroid, NK, B) lineage potentials. Aberrant differentiation during these stages can result in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, the mechanisms regulating the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation are obscure. Through loss of function studies, we showed BCL11B, a transcription factor recurrently mutated T-ALL, is essential for T-lineage commitment, particularly the repression of NK and myeloid potentials, and the induction of T-lineage genes, during the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation. In gain of function studies, BCL11B inhibited growth of and induced a T-lineage transcriptional program in T-ALL cells. We found previously unknown differentiation stage-specific DNA binding of BCL11B at multiple T-lineage genes; target genes showed BCL11B-dependent expression, suggesting a transcriptional activator role for BCL11B at these genes. Transcriptional analyses revealed differences in the regulatory actions of BCL11B between human and murine thymopoiesis. Our studies show BCL11B is a key regulator of the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation and delineate the BCL11B transcriptional program, enabling the dissection of the underpinnings of normal T-cell differentiation and providing a resource for understanding dysregulations in T-ALL.

28282452	<TITLE>SP-LL-37, human antimicrobial peptide, enhances disease resistance in transgenic rice.</TITLE>Human LL-37 is a multifunctional antimicrobial peptide of cathelicidin family. It has been shown in recent studies that it can serve as a host's defense against influenza A virus. We now demonstrate in this study how signal peptide LL-37 (SP-LL-37) can be used in rice resistance against bacterial leaf blight and blast. We synthesized LL-37 peptide and subcloned in a recombinant pPZP vector with pGD1 as promoter. SP-LL-37 was introduced into rice plants by Agrobacterium mediated transformation. Stable expression of SP-LL-37 in transgenic rice plants was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA analyses. Subcellular localization of SP-LL-37-GFP fusion protein showed evidently in intercellular space. Our data on testing for resistance to bacterial leaf blight and blast revealed that the transgenic lines are highly resistant compared to its wildtype. Our results suggest that LL-37 can be further explored to improve wide-spectrum resistance to biotic stress in rice.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28289273	<TITLE>Metastatic Colonic Adenocarcinoma to the Extrahepatic Common Bile Duct: The Critical Role of the Pathologist and Immunohistochemistry in Guiding Patient Care Decisions.</TITLE>BACKGROUND Adenocarcinoma of the colon frequently invades adjacent organs, spreads intraperitoneal, and metastasizes to intestinal lymph nodes, lungs, and the liver. Metastasis solely to the extrahepatic bile duct is extremely rare and has only been previously reported on 15 occasions. The accurate determination that an extrahepatic common bile duct lesion is of colonic origin has critical therapeutic implications. CASE REPORT The patient was a 50-year-old male with a history of colon cancer S/P surgical resection in September 2014. At that time, the tumor extended to the serosal margin, and was staged as pT4a N0 MX stage II. In April of 2016, the patientwas admitted to our facility and an ERCP was performed. A biopsy was performed during the ERCP followed by sphincterotomy and metal stent placement. The surgical pathology revealed an adenocarcinoma with surrounding benign glandular structures. The surrounding benign glands served as an appropriate control when compared to the malignant glands. The benign glands were positive for CK-7 and the malignant glands were negative for CK-7. The malignant glands were also positive for CK-20 and CDX-2, and the benign glands were negative for CK-20 and CDX-2. This profile was consistent with an adenocarcinoma metastasis from colon primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS This case superbly illustrates the critical role of the pathologist, and their knowledge and understanding of immunohistochemistry, in arriving at the correct diagnosis and in assisting surgeons and oncologists in guiding the care, management, and appropriate therapeutic decisions regarding patients. In patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), immunohistochemistry is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis as treatment options can be very different based on diagnosis.

28326426	<TITLE>Use of locking plates for fixation of the greater trochanter in patients with hip replacement.</TITLE>Fixation of the greater trochanter with total hip replacement is challenging and associated with short- and long-term complications. Locking plate technology has been used for fixation of other bones and may be applied successfully in trochanteric fixation. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the utility of the use of trochanteric locking plates in total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients.|From 2004 to 2014, 32 procedures were performed to fix the greater trochanter in patients with trochanteric fracture, osteotomy, or nonunion in the setting of THA. The median age at the time of surgery was 69 years. This was a primary arthroplasty in 8 of the patients, conversion from prior hip surgery in 5, and a revision in 19. The greater trochanter was fixed with locking plate alone in 15 hips and with the addition of a single cerclage cable in 17 hips. Patients were followed clinically and radiographically until healing occurred. The median duration of radiographic follow-up was 41.6 months (range: 10-112 months).|Osseous union occurred in 29 (90.6%) of 32 hips. The median Harris hip score was 94 (range 54-100, standard deviation = 10.4) at latest follow-up. Complications included broken hardware in 5 (15.6%) patients, of which 3 underwent subsequent hardware removal. Two additional patients elected hardware removal due to trochanteric pain.|Locking plate technology is a successful method of fixation of the greater trochanter in patients with THA. Postoperative trochanteric pain and reoperation for hardware-related issues remain a challenge.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28346239	<TITLE>Elevated Expression of Kin17 in Cervical Cancer and Its Association With Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasion.</TITLE>Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that kin17 is a tumor-promoting protein in some types of solid tumors. However, whether kin17 contributes to cervical cancer carcinogenesis remains unknown.|Kin17 expression in clinical samples from Guangdong Women and Children's Hospital and Health Institute was detected by immunohistochemical staining. A series of functional experiments including 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assay, colony formation, transwell assay, flow cytometry of apoptosis, and cell cycle were performed to explore the roles of kin17 in cervical cancer cells HeLa.|In this study, we showed for the first time that the expression of kin17 was significantly increased in clinical cervical cancer samples, and associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and ki-67 expression in a clinicopathologic characteristics review. Furthermore, silence of kin17 in HeLa cells inhibited cell proliferation, clone formation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion, and also promoted cell apoptosis.|Our findings demonstrate that kin17 is closely related to the cell proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer and could be a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for cervical cancer management. The underlying mechanisms should be elucidated in future research.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28352922	<TITLE>Luminescence spectroscopy of chalcogen substituted rhodamine cations in vacuo.</TITLE>Intrinsic optical properties of several rhodamine cations were probed by measuring their dispersed fluorescence spectra in vacuo. Three different rhodamine structures were investigated, each with four different chalcogen heteroatoms. Fluorescence band maxima were blue-shifted by between 0.15 and 0.20 eV (1200-1600 cm-1) relative to previous solution-phase measurements. Trends in emission wavelengths and fluorescence quantum yields previously measured in solution are generally reproduced in the gas phase, confirming the intrinsic nature of these effects. One important exception is gas-phase brightness of the Texas Red analogues, which is significantly higher than the other rhodamine structures studied, despite having similar fluorescence quantum yields in solution. These results expand the library of fluorophores for which gas-phase photophysical data is available, and will aid in the design of experiments utilizing gas-phase structural biology methods such as Förster resonance energy transfer.

28374836	<TITLE>A semi-synchronous label propagation algorithm with constraints for community detection in complex networks.</TITLE>Community structure is an important feature of a complex network, where detection of the community structure can shed some light on the properties of such a complex network. Amongst the proposed community detection methods, the label propagation algorithm (LPA) emerges as an effective detection method due to its time efficiency. Despite this advantage in computational time, the performance of LPA is affected by randomness in the algorithm. A modified LPA, called CLPA-GNR, was proposed recently and it succeeded in handling the randomness issues in the LPA. However, it did not remove the tendency for trivial detection in networks with a weak community structure. In this paper, an improved CLPA-GNR is therefore proposed. In the new algorithm, the unassigned and assigned nodes are updated synchronously while the assigned nodes are updated asynchronously. A similarity score, based on the Sørensen-Dice index, is implemented to detect the initial communities and for breaking ties during the propagation process. Constraints are utilised during the label propagation and community merging processes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on various benchmark and real-world networks. We find that it is able to avoid trivial detection while showing substantial improvement in the quality of detection.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We estimated linear regression models of I/ADL trajectories comparing individuals who remained stroke-free throughout follow-up (n = 16,264), those who survived stroke (n = 1,374), and those who died after stroke and before the next interview wave (n = 479). We evaluated whether I/ADL trajectories differed by physical activity or BMI at baseline (before stroke), adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic covariates.|Compared to those who were physically active, stroke survivors who were physically inactive at baseline had a lower probability of independence in ADLs and IADLs 3 years after stroke (risk difference = -0.18 and -0.16 for ADLs and IADLs, respectively). However, a similar difference in the probability of independence was also present 3 years before stroke, and we observed no evidence that physical activity slowed the rate of decline in independence before or after stroke. Unlike the results for physical activity, we did not observe a consistent pattern for the probability of independence in ADLs or IADLs comparing obese stroke survivors to normal-weight or to overweight stroke survivors 3 years before stroke or 3 years after stroke.|Physical inactivity predicts a higher risk of being dependent both before and after stroke.

28420892	<TITLE>Adenomyomatosis Concomitant with Primary Gallbladder Carcinoma.</TITLE>Some clinicians have proposed a relationship between gallbladder (GB) cancer and adenomyomatosis (ADM) of the gallbladder, although the latter condition is not considered to have malignant potential. We retrospectively reviewed the surgical pathology database of patients who underwent resection for ADM of the gallbladder at our institution from March 2005 to May 2015. In total, 624 patients underwent surgical resection of the gallbladder with Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Of these cases, 93 were pathologically diagnosed with ADM of the gallbladder, with 44 (47.3%) classified macroscopically as fundal-type ADM, 26 (28.0%) as segmental type, and 23 (24.7%) as diffuse-type ADM. In 3 of the 93 (3.2%) resected specimens, early-stage GB carcinoma was detected, although preoperative imaging did not suggest a malignant neoplasm of the gallbladder in any of these patients. GB cancer subsequently developed in the mucosa of the fundal compartment distal to the annular stricture of the segmental-type ADM in 2 of these patients and against the background of the fundal-type ADM in 1 patient. This study revealed the difficulty of early diagnosis of primary GB cancer in the setting of concurrent ADM, and clinicians should be aware of this frequent coexistence.

28438764	<TITLE>Neurogenic hypertension and the secrets of respiration.</TITLE>Despite recent advances in the knowledge of the neural control of cardiovascular function, the cause of sympathetic overactivity in neurogenic hypertension remains unknown. Studies from our laboratory point out that rats submitted to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), an experimental model of neurogenic hypertension, present changes in the central respiratory network that impact the pattern of sympathetic discharge and the levels of arterial pressure. In addition to the fine coordination of respiratory muscle contraction and relaxation, which is essential for O2 and CO2 pulmonary exchanges, neurons of the respiratory network are connected precisely to the neurons controlling the sympathetic activity in the brain stem. This respiratory-sympathetic neuronal interaction provides adjustments in the sympathetic outflow to the heart and vasculature during each respiratory phase according to the metabolic demands. Herein, we report that CIH-induced sympathetic over activity and mild hypertension are associated with increased frequency discharge of ventral medullary presympathetic neurons. We also describe that their increased frequency discharge is dependent on synaptic inputs, mostly from neurons of the brain stem respiratory network, rather than changes in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In perspective, we are taking into consideration the possibility that changes in the central respiratory rhythm/pattern generator contribute to increased sympathetic outflow and the development of neurogenic hypertension. Our experimental evidence provides support for the hypothesis that changes in the coupling of respiratory and sympathetic networks might be one of the unrevealed secrets of neurogenic hypertension in rats.

28527732	<TITLE>Descriptive study of the frequency of medical adhesive-related skin injuries in a vascular clinic.</TITLE>A medical adhesive can be defined as a product used to secure a device (ie, tape, dressing, catheter, electrode, and ostomy pouch) to the skin. Skin injury related to medical adhesive usage occurs across all care settings with medical adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSIs) playing a significant role with patient safety. The purpose of this descriptive prospective study was to assess all adult patients with wounds seen in the vascular clinic for MARSI by the CWOCN NP over a 3-month time period. One hundred twenty patients comprising a total of 207 visits were seen by the CWOCN NP over the 3-month time frame. Seven patients presented to the clinic from home with MARSI for a frequency of 5.8%. There were four males and three females with ages ranging from 52 to 83 years with a mean age of 67.7 years. All patients had a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease with MARSI present on the lower extremities. Six of the seven MARSI cases were related to having paper tape removed from the periwound skin at home resulting in epidermal stripping either by the home health care professional (N = 4) or by the patient themselves (N = 2). The other MARSI was related to tension blister from steri-strips applied with benzoin by health care professional on a lower leg incision. Patients were unclear as far as when these injuries had occurred and often remarked that they thought that tape injuries were unpreventable. There is a need for additional research studies examining MARSI frequency across care settings such as the vascular population to identify those at risk and then implement measures to prevent it.

28548090	<TITLE>Synergistic IL-6 and IL-8 paracrine signalling pathway infers a strategy to inhibit tumour cell migration.</TITLE>Following uncontrolled proliferation, a subset of primary tumour cells acquires additional traits/mutations to trigger phenotypic changes that enhance migration and are hypothesized to be the initiators of metastasis. This study reveals an adaptive mechanism that harnesses synergistic paracrine signalling via IL-6/8, which is amplified by cell proliferation and cell density, to directly promote cell migration. This effect occurs in metastatic human sarcoma and carcinoma cells- but not in normal or non-metastatic cancer cells-, and likely involves the downstream signalling of WASF3 and Arp2/3. The transcriptional phenotype of high-density cells that emerges due to proliferation resembles that of low-density cells treated with a combination of IL-6/8. Simultaneous inhibition of IL-6/8 receptors decreases the expression of WASF3 and Arp2/3 in a mouse xenograft model and reduces metastasis. This study reveals a potential mechanism that promotes tumour cell migration and infers a strategy to decrease metastatic capacity of tumour cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28564906	<TITLE>EVOLUTION OF PLANT POLLINATION SYSTEMS: HYPOTHESES AND TESTS WITH THE NEOTROPICAL VINE DALECHAMPIA.</TITLE>The results of pollination and mating-system studies were integrated with a phylogenetic study of 40 Neotropical species of Dalechampia L. (Euphorbiaceae) to reconstruct the history of evolutionary change in pollination systems. The results of this analysis were treated as a hypothesis and tested for circularity problems and robustness in the face of changes in the data set. The historical hypothesis was used to make specific predictions about details of pollination ecology and reward biochemistry; the predictions were supported by independent observations. I conclude that pollination systems in Dalechampia have been evolutionarily labile, relative to most morphological features, with repeated parallelisms and reversals. Transitions among the three pollination systems evolved by Dalechampia (pollination by resin-collecting bees, fragrance-collecting male euglossine bees, and pollen-collecting bees) have been facilitated by biochemical exaptation (preadaptation). Pollination by male euglossine bees is relatively rare in the genus but has originated independently three to four times. In contrast, pollination by resin-collecting female bees is very common, but has originated only once. Eighty-six to 97% of transitions between pollination systems involved an intermediate phase during which both old and new pollinators were effective, but 3 to 14% of transitions may have been "instantaneous," lacking the intermediate phase. Clades of species secreting resin rewards are about 10 times as species rich as clades of species secreting fragrance rewards; circumstantial evidence suggests that different extinction rates may be responsible for this difference. Relatively allogamous (cross-pollinating) species have evolved from more autogamous (self-pollinating) species up to 13 times, and autogamous species have evolved from more allogamous ones up to 11 times. Species occurring in disturbed habitats are facultatively autogamous, whereas species of undisturbed habitats are often highly allogamous.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We constructed phylogenetic trees for 794 subtype A1 and 64 subtype B sequences and identified factors associated with transmission clustering. Clusters were defined as ≥2 sequences, ≥80% local branch support, and maximum genetic distance of all sequence pairs in the cluster ≤2.5%. Recent infection was determined through the limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay. Sequences were analyzed for transmitted drug resistance mutations.|Thirty percent of subtype A1 and 66% of subtype B sequences clustered. Large clusters (maximum 11 sequences) contained mixed risk groups. In univariate analysis, clustering was significantly associated with subtype B compared to A1 (odds ratio [OR], 4.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.56-7.50]); risk group (OR, 5.65 [95% CI, 3.27-9.75]) for men who have sex with men compared to heterosexual males; recent, compared to long-standing, infection (OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.64-4.52]); reported sex work contact (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.07-3.47]); and younger age groups compared with age ≥36 years (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.10-3.05] for age ≤25 years). Females were associated with lower odds of clustering than heterosexual males (OR, 0.49 [95% CI, .31-.77]). In multivariate analysis, risk group, subtype, and age group were independently associated with clustering (P < .001, P = .007, and P = .033, respectively). Eighteen sequences (2.1%) indicated evidence of transmitted drug resistance.|Our findings suggest high levels of transmission and bridging between risk groups.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28660885	<TITLE>Factors associated with antihypertensive medication non-adherence: a systematic review.</TITLE>Non-adherence to antihypertensive medication is the most important cause of uncontrolled blood pressure and is influenced by multiple interrelating factors. Understanding the complexity of medication non-adherence and its associated factors is important to determine intervention strategies. Therefore, a systematic review was performed aimed to identify factors associated with antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Different databases were searched for observational studies reporting on factors associated with non-adherence to antihypertensive medication. Titles, abstracts and full texts were reviewed by three researchers. Subsequently, the methodological quality of each study was assessed. Factors that were extracted from the included studies were categorised as factors with consistent or inconsistent evidence to put their potential importance into perspective. Forty-four studies were included. Higher co-payment, side effects and a poor patient-provider relationship were identified as factors with consistent evidence since consistent significant relationships were found for these factors whenever studied. The relationships between non-adherence and multiple other factors were inconsistent among the reviewed studies. However, some of these factors deserve some consideration. Since multiple potentially relevant factors were identified, patient-tailored interventions focussing on identifying and addressing patients' specific barriers to adherence are needed. Further research should clarify the influence of inconsistent factors on adherence and their potential to be addressed in interventions.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
28680386	<TITLE>Correlates of irregular family meal patterns among 11-year-old children from the Pro Children study.</TITLE>Background: The importance of family meals to the consumption of healthful food choices has been stated in recent reviews. However, little information is available on barriers that interfere with regular family meal patterns during childhood. Objective: Describe family meal patterns among 11-year-old children across Europe and identify correlates of irregular family breakfast and dinner consumption. Design: Cross-sectional survey involving samples of 13,305 children from nine European countries in 2003. Results: The proportions of children who regularly ate family breakfast and dinner were 62% and 90%, respectively. Correlates of irregular family breakfasts and dinners were less vegetable consumption, and irregular family breakfasts were associated with more television viewing. Social differences in the consumption of family breakfasts were observed. Discussion: Strengths of this study are the large sample size and validated research method. Limitations are the cross-sectional design and self-reported data. Conclusion: The majority of 11-year-old children regularly ate breakfast and dinner with their families. Less vegetable consumption and more television viewing were associated with irregular family breakfasts and dinners, respectively. Social differences were observed in the regularity of family breakfasts. Promoting family meals across social class may lead to healthier eating and activity habits, sustainable at the population Level.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The psychometric testing included factor analysis, internal consistency, precision, and differential item functioning (DIF) across categories including sex, older age, marital status, and physical impairment area.|The sample had a mean age of 69.7 years old (SD = 13.7). The majority of the sample had lower extremity impairments (62.0%) and had at least 2.1 chronic conditions. The instrument demonstrated unidimensional construct and good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95). The instrument precisely estimated person measures within a wide range of theta values (-2.22 logits < θ < 0.27 logits) with a reliability of 0.9. Only the changing position item demonstrated misfit (χ2 = 36.6, df = 17, p = 0.0038), and the dressing item demonstrated DIF on the impairment type (upper extremity/others, McFadden's Pseudo R 2 > 5.0%).|Our findings indicate that the dressing item would need to be modified to improve its psychometrics. Overall, the ADL instrument demonstrates good psychometrics, and thus, it may be used as a standardized instrument for measuring disability in rehabilitation contexts. However, the findings are limited to adults with physical disabilities. Future studies should replicate psychometric testing for survey respondents with other disorders and for children.

28802140	<TITLE>Cell density dependence of Microcystis aeruginosa responses to copper algaecide concentrations: Implications for microcystin-LR release.</TITLE>Along with mechanistic models, predictions of exposure-response relationships for copper are often derived from laboratory toxicity experiments with standardized experimental exposures and conditions. For predictions of copper toxicity to algae, cell density is a critical factor often overlooked. For pulse exposures of copper-based algaecides in aquatic systems, cell density can significantly influence copper sorbed by the algal population, and consequent responses. A cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, was exposed to a copper-based algaecide over a range of cell densities to model the density-dependence of exposures, and effects on microcystin-LR (MC-LR) release. Copper exposure concentrations were arrayed to result in a gradient of MC-LR release, and masses of copper sorbed to algal populations were measured following exposures. While copper exposure concentrations eliciting comparable MC-LR release ranged an order of magnitude (24-h EC50s 0.03-0.3mg Cu/L) among cell densities of 106 through 107 cells/mL, copper doses (mg Cu/mg algae) were similar (24-h EC50s 0.005-0.006mg Cu/mg algae). Comparisons of MC-LR release as a function of copper exposure concentrations and doses provided a metric of the density dependence of algal responses in the context of copper-based algaecide applications. Combined with estimates of other site-specific factors (e.g. water characteristics) and fate processes (e.g. dilution and dispersion, sorption to organic matter and sediments), measuring exposure-response relationships for specific cell densities can refine predictions for in situ exposures and algal responses. These measurements can in turn decrease the likelihood of amending unnecessary copper concentrations to aquatic systems, and minimize risks for non-target aquatic organisms.

28803218	<TITLE>Do you hear 'feather' when listening to 'rain'? Lexical tone activation during unconscious translation: Evidence from Mandarin-English bilinguals.</TITLE>Although lexical tone is a highly prevalent phonetic cue in human languages, its role in bilingual spoken word recognition is not well understood. The present study investigates whether and how adult bilinguals, who use pitch contours to disambiguate lexical items in one language but not the other, access a tonal L1 when exclusively processing a non-tonal L2. Using the visual world paradigm, we show that Mandarin-English listeners automatically activated Mandarin translation equivalents of English target words such as 'rain' (Mandarin 'yu3'), and consequently were distracted by competitors whose segments and tones overlapped with the translations of English target words ('feather', also 'yu3' in Mandarin). Importantly, listeners were not distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in all segments but not tone ('fish'; Mandarin 'yu2'), nor were they distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in rime and tone ('wheat', Mandarin 'gu3'). These novel results demonstrate implicit access to L1 lexical representations through automatic/unconscious translation, as a result of cross-language top-down and/or lateral influence, and highlight the critical role of lexical tone activation in bilingual lexical access.

28813049	<TITLE>Unprecedented solvent induced inter-conversion between monomeric and dimeric silylene-zinc iodide adducts.</TITLE>Usually, when a silylene reacts with a transition metal Lewis acid, it forms an adduct which could be either monomeric or dimeric. However, we present here that a silylene, [PhC(NtBu)2SiN(SiMe3)2] can form both monomeric [PhC(NtBu)2Si{N(SiMe3)2} → ZnI2]·THF (1) and dimeric [{PhC(NtBu)2}(N(SiMe3)2)SiZnI,(μ-I)]2 (2) adducts upon reaction with ZnI2. The formation of 1 and 2 relies upon the solvent used for the reaction or crystallization. When the crystallization is carried out in THF complex 1 is formed, however, when the reaction and crystallization are performed in acetonitrile complex 2 is obtained. Both 1 and 2 were structurally authenticated and the nature of the Si-Zn bond in these complexes was determined by quantum chemical calculations. In addition, a spontaneous inter-conversion between 1 and 2 just by changing the solvents has been also observed; a feature presently not known for silylene-transition metal Lewis adducts.

28815365	<TITLE>The effect of dichlorvos on control of drosophila and its safety evaluation under different application methods.</TITLE>Drosophila is a common strawberry pest. In this work, toxicities of the 77.5% EC dichlorvos to 3rd instar larvae and adults of drosophila were evaluated through indoor bioassays and field bioassays, respectively. To insure the safety, dichlorvos dissipation and terminal residue in strawberry by different application methods under field conditions were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The decline curves of dichlorvos residues in strawberry corresponded with first-order kinetics, and dichlorvos dissipated rapidly in strawberry with half-life (t1/2) of 7.58-13.17 h. Terminal residues below the maximum residue limit of strawberry and soil in different distance were achieved after 24 h under different application methods. This article provides guidance to the proper and safe use of dichlorvos in agriculture; it is more reasonable that dichlorvos is applied by embedding on the ground near the strawberry plants covered plastic film with holes.

28862970	<TITLE>Clinical Outcomes of Deferred Lesions With Angiographically Insignificant Stenosis But Low Fractional Flow Reserve.</TITLE>Data are limited regarding outcomes of deferred lesions in patients with angiographically insignificant stenosis but low fractional flow reserve (FFR). We investigated the natural history of angiographically insignificant stenosis with low FFR among patients who underwent routine 3-vessel FFR measurement.|From December 2011 to March 2014, 1136 patients with 3298 vessels underwent routine 3-vessel FFR measurement (3V FFR-FRIENDS study, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01621438), and this study analyzed the 2-year clinical outcomes of 1024 patients with 2124 lesions with angiographically insignificant stenosis (percentage of diameter stenosis <50%), in which revascularization was deferred. All lesions were classified according to FFR values, using a cutoff of 0.80 (high FFR >0.80 versus low FFR ≤0.80). The primary end point was outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization) at 2 years. Mean angiographic percentage of diameter stenosis and FFR of total lesions were 32.5±10.3% and 0.91±0.08%, respectively. Among the total lesions with angiographically insignificant stenosis, 8.7% showed low FFR (185 lesions). The incidence of lesions with low FFR was 2.5%, 3.8%, 9.0%, and 15.1% in categories of percentage of diameter stenosis <20%, 20% to 30%, 30% to 40%, and 40% to 50%, respectively. At 2-year follow-up, the low-FFR group showed a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with the high FFR group (3.3% versus 1.2%, hazard ratio: 3.371; 95% CI, 1.346-8.442; P=0.009). In multivariable analysis, low FFR was the most powerful independent predictor of future MACE in deferred lesions with angiographically insignificant stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.617; 95% CI, 1.026-6.679; P=0.044).|In deferred angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.

29063966	<TITLE>The Draft Genome Sequence of Clostridium beijerinckii NJP7, a Unique Bacterium Capable of Producing Isopropanol-Butanol from Hemicellulose Through Consolidated Bioprocessing.</TITLE>A wild type solventogenic Clostridium beijerinckii NJP7 capable of converting polysaccharides, such as hemicellulose, into butanol and isopropanol via a unique acetone-isopropanol-butanol (AIB) pathway was isolated and characterized. This represents the first wild type isopropanol-butanol generating bacterium which could achieve butanol production directly from lignocellulose through consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). Strain NJP7 was isolated from decomposite soil from Laoshan Nature Park, China, and its genome shows 98.6% identical to 89.5% of the Clostridium diolis submitted genome sequence. The assembled draft genome contains 5.76 Mb and 5101 predicted encoding proteins with a GC content of 29.73%. Among these annotated proteins, hemicellulase and the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase play key roles in achievement of AIB production from hemicellulose through CBP.

29101947	<TITLE>Safety of Non-Operating Room Anesthesia: A Closed Claims Update.</TITLE>Malpractice claims for non-operating room anesthesia care (NORA) had a higher proportion of claims for death than claims in operating rooms (ORs). NORA claims most frequently involved monitored anesthesia care. Inadequate oxygenation/ventilation was responsible for one-third of NORA claims, often judged probably preventable by better monitoring. Fewer malpractice claims for NORA occurred than for OR anesthesia as assessed by the relative numbers of in NORA versus OR procedures. The proportion of claims in cardiology and radiology NORA locations were increased compared with estimates of cases in these locations. Although NORA is safe, adherence to safe clinical practice is important.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29170705	<TITLE>Energy Cost of Active and Sedentary Music Video Games: Drum and Handheld Gaming vs. Walking and Sitting.</TITLE>To compare energy expenditure during and after active and handheld video game drumming compared to walking and sitting. Ten experienced, college-aged men performed four protocols (one per week): no-exercise seated control (CTRL), virtual drumming on a handheld gaming device (HANDHELD), active drumming on drum pads (DRUM), and walking on a treadmill at ~30% of VO2max (WALK). Protocols were performed after an overnight fast, and expired air was collected continuously during (30min) and after (30min) exercise. DRUM and HANDHELD song lists, day of the week, and time of day were identical for each participant. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among the average rates of energy expenditure (kcal·min-1) during activity included WALK > DRUM > HANDHELD. No significant differences in the rates of energy expenditure among groups during recovery were observed. Total energy expenditure was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during WALK (149.5 ± 30.6 kcal) compared to DRUM (118.7 ± 18.8 kcal) and HANDHELD (44.9±11.6 kcal), and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD. Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD (44.9 ± 11.6 kcal) and CTRL (38.2 ± 6.0 kcal). Active video game drumming at expert-level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld, but it hardly met moderate-intensity activity standards, and energy expenditure was greatest during walking. Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no-exercise control. Thus, traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health, individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower-body musculature, and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle.

29189298	<TITLE>Laboratory examinations for the vestibular system.</TITLE>In the last decades, researchers suggested that clinical assessment of labyrinthine function in detail became easy thanks to video head impulse tests (VHITs), vestibular evoked myogenic potential test (VEMP) and video-oculography (VOG). It has been argued that they can replace electronystagmography, the caloric and rotatory chair tests. This review addresses the latest evaluations of these tests and the opportunities they offer, but also the limitations in clinical practice.|The VHIT and suppression head impulse test (SHIMP) are under ideal circumstances able to accurately identify deficits of the VOR in 3D. However, in a relevant part of the patient population, pupil tracking is inaccurate, video-goggles slip and VOR quantification is problematic. The dissociation between the VHIT and caloric test suggests that these tests are complementary. A new 3D-VOG technique claims to quantify eye torsion better than before, opening multiple diagnostic possibilities. VEMPs remain difficult to standardize. Variability in normal cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential amplitude is large. VEMPs become smaller or absent with age, raising questions of whether there is a lower normal limit at all. Recent research shows that the labyrinth is directly stimulated in the MRI offering new opportunities for diagnostics and research.|In clinical practice, the VHIT, SHIMP, VEMP and new 3D-VOG techniques improve diagnostic power. Unfortunately, technical issues or variability prevent reliable quantitative evaluation in a part of the regular patient population. The traditional caloric and rotatory chair test can still be considered as valuable complementary tests.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Classic presentation includes livedo reticularis, vasculitis, and stroke. However, the phenotype and disease severity are variable. We present a 5-year-old female who presented with features that mimicked autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in the absence of classic features of DADA2. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous splicing variant in ADA2 c.882-2A > G. Patient responded to anti- tumor necrosis factor medication and is in complete remission. Hematologists should be aware of various hematological presentations of DADA2, including ALPS-like disorder, that might lack vasculitis and livedo reticularis to prevent delay in initiating optimal therapy.

29280550	<TITLE>Determination of macrolide antibiotics residues in pork using molecularly imprinted dispersive solid-phase extraction coupled with LC-MS/MS.</TITLE>A class-specific macrolide molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using tulathromycin as the template and methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. The polymers revealed different specific adsorption and imprinting factor for macrolides with different spatial arrangement of side chains as well as lactonic ring size. And the molecularly imprinted polymer possessed maximum adsorption capacity (54.1 mg/g) and highest imprinting factor (2.4) toward 15-membered ring azithromycin. On the basis of molecularly imprinted polymer dispersive solid-phase extraction, a rapid, selective, and reproducible method for simultaneous determination of seven macrolide antibiotics residues in pork was established by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. At spiking levels of 5, 10, 25, and 100 μg/kg, average recoveries of seven macrolides ranged from 68.6 to 95.5% with intraday and interday relative standard deviations below 8%. The limits of detection and limits of quantification were 0.2-0.5 and 0.5-2.0 μg/kg, respectively.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29290447	<TITLE>Herd-level prevalence of the ultrasonographic lung lesions associated with bovine respiratory disease and related environmental risk factors.</TITLE>Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) is a major calf disease during the preweaning period. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) has been recently described as a reliable tool for assessing BRD-associated lung lesions. The objectives of this study were to define the herd-level prevalence of lung consolidation assessed by TUS (CONSTUS). A total of 39 Québec dairy herds were randomly chosen to participate in this cross-sectional study. Between 6 and 12 preweaned calves were examined for signs of CONSTUS defined by any site with ≥3 cm consolidated lung tissue during 1 visit in summer and 1 visit in winter. Herd questionnaire focused on calf health and housing data [airborne bacteria (aerobic, coliform, yeasts and mold counts), air drafts, temperature, hygrometry, and ammonia levels] were also collected during these visits looking for potential association with CONSTUS prevalence. The median herd-level of CONSTUS prevalence (interquartile range) were 8% (0-22%) in summer and 15% (0-35%) in winter. Multivariable analyses showed that season was associated with an increased CONSTUS prevalence [10.0 vs. 19.3%; odds ratio (OR) = 2.16], as well as group housing during preweaned period (9.6 vs. 20.0%; OR = 2.37) and perceived BRD problem by the farmer (10.6 vs. 18.3%; OR = 1.89). Despite tremendous changes in calves' environment between winter and summer, none of the housing variables were associated with the CONSTUS prevalence in this study. Based on the observed CONSTUS prevalence ranges in the present study (herds in the lower prevalence quartile), an achievable goal of none of 12 calves with consolidation ≥3 cm can potentially be used to define a low-BRD risk herd.

29293713	<TITLE>Effects of tail docking and tail biting on performance and welfare of growing-finishing pigs in a confinement housing system.</TITLE>A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of tail docking on the welfare and performance of victimized pigs by tail biting and tail biters. Pigs ( = 240; 25.7 ± 2.9 kg average weight), including 120 pigs that were tail docked at birth and 120 pigs that remained with intact tails, were used. Pigs were housed in 8 pens of 30 pigs in a confinement barn for 16 wk, with 4 pens each housing pigs of both sexes with docked or intact tails. Tail biters and victimized pigs with damaged tails were identified during outbreaks of tail biting. Growth performance was monitored, and skin lesions on the tail, ears, and body were assessed. Blood samples were collected from focal tail biters, victimized pigs, and nonvictimized pigs for analysis of total serum protein, IgG, and substance P concentrations. When pigs were marketed, carcass weights and the number of pigs with carcass trim loss were recorded. During the growing-finishing period, 48% of pigs with docked tails and 89% of pigs with intact tails experienced lesions on their tails, including 5% of docked pigs and 30% of intact pigs identified as victimized pigs that experienced puncture wounds with signs of infection on their tails or loss of tails ( < 0.001). Victimized pigs tended to gain less weight ( = 0.07) between 17 and 21 wk of age than other pigs when tail biting prevailed in this study. Victimized pigs were more frequently ( = 0.04) sold for less than full value and had a lower dressing percentage ( < 0.001) compared with nonvictimized pigs. For victimized pigs, total serum protein and IgG concentrations were elevated 5 d after tails were injured, suggesting that tail damage can cause inflammation, which may lead to carcass abscesses and trim loss. Compared with victimized pigs and nonvictimized pigs, tail biters had lower total serum protein ( = 0.01) and IgG ( = 0.01) concentrations, indicating that tail biters may experience poor immune functions. Results of this study demonstrated that tail docking reduced tail damage in pigs kept in a confinement system. Tail damage can cause inflammation and reduce the value of market pigs. More research is needed to test whether compromised immune functions predispose pigs to tail biting.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29306352	<TITLE>Porcine commensal Escherichia coli: a reservoir for class 1 integrons associated with IS26.</TITLE>Porcine faecal waste is a serious environmental pollutant. Carriage of antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence-associated genes (VAGs), and the zoonotic potential of commensal Escherichia coli from swine are largely unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the role of commensal E. coli as contributors to the mobilization of ARGs between food animals and the environment. Here, we report whole-genome sequence analysis of 103 class 1 integron-positive E. coli from the faeces of healthy pigs from two commercial production facilities in New South Wales, Australia. Most strains belonged to phylogroups A and B1, and carried VAGs linked with extraintestinal infection in humans. The 103 strains belonged to 37 multilocus sequence types and clonal complex 10 featured prominently. Seventeen ARGs were detected and 97 % (100/103) of strains carried three or more ARGs. Heavy-metal-resistance genes merA, cusA and terA were also common. IS26 was observed in 98 % (101/103) of strains and was often physically associated with structurally diverse class 1 integrons that carried unique genetic features, which may be tracked. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first detailed genomic analysis and point of reference for commensal E. coli of porcine origin in Australia, facilitating tracking of specific lineages and the mobile resistance genes they carry.

Despite efforts to increase cervical cancer (CC) screening among VAW, the participation rates are persistently low (69% to 81%). The purpose of this study was to explore health care providers' (HCPs) perspectives on barriers and facilitators to CC screening in VAW.|This qualitative descriptive pilot study, used open-ended semistructured interviews with 10 HCPs.|The HCPs had two to 23 years treating VAW. Major barriers and facilitators identified by the HCPs were as follows: VAW's decision making about CC screening; sexual health divide; language discordance, relying on interpreters; breaking suspicion; VAW's exposure to health sources of CC screening; sustainable trust; and motivated health care practices.|HCPs perceived the reasons for VAW not being screened or delaying CC screening were due to their lack of knowledge, cultural barriers, language, and issues related to trust.

Both distance and near deviation were evaluated before surgery, during surgery in both positions (seated and supine), and at 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. A final horizontal deviation <10 pd and a vertical deviation <5 pd without diplopia was considered to be a good outcome (3 months after surgery).|The mean age of the sample was 55 years and 76.7% were women. Most had esotropia (70%). The most frequently used surgical combination was the medial rectus and lateral rectus (36.7%). Surgical adjustment was necessary in 40% of cases. Mean preoperative deviation was 21.9 ± 12.63 pd (distance) and 20.66 ± 4.76 (near). Deviation with the patient supine was 8 ± 8.25 pd (distance) and 7.26 ± 5.81 (near). Deviation with the patient seated was 8.13 pd±8.38 (distance) and 8.5 ± 7.41 (near). There was no significant difference between the positions.

Speech and environmental sound recognition by individuals with CI and normal-hearing (NH) was measured. Gradients were also computed to evaluate the pattern of change in identification performance with respect to the low-pass filtering or high-pass filtering cutoff frequencies.|Frequency-limiting effects were implemented in the acoustic waveforms by passing the signals through low-pass filters (LPFs) or high-pass filters (HPFs) with seven different cutoff frequencies. Identification of Korean vowels and consonants produced by a male and female speaker and environmental sounds was measured. Crossover frequencies were determined for each identification test, where the LPF and HPF conditions show the identical identification scores.|CI and NH subjects showed changes in identification performance in a similar manner as a function of cutoff frequency for the LPF and HPF conditions, suggesting that the degraded spectral information in the acoustic signals may similarly constraint the identification performance for both subject groups. However, CI subjects were generally less efficient than NH subjects in using the limited spectral information for speech and environmental sound identification due to the inefficient coding of acoustic cues through the CI sound processors.|This finding will provide vital information in Korean for understanding how different the frequency information is in receiving speech and environmental sounds by CI processor from normal hearing.

29345538	<TITLE>Real-time monitoring of nanoscale TiO2 concentration by spectrophotometry: implications of agglomeration due to natural organic matter and multivalent ions.</TITLE>The study of the environmental fate of nanoscale TiO2 (n-TiO2) is a major recent research focus which requires a rapid and accurate on-site concentration determination method. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) has been the most widely used method for determining the concentration of n-TiO2 in environmental samples; however, poses many challenges, such as hazardous hydrofluoric acid pre-treatment and clear limitations in mobile on-site measurement and monitoring. This study demonstrates that industrial wastewater containing natural organic matter (NOM) can present a major challenge to the analysis of n-TiO2 by ICP-MS, and introduces a spectrophotometry technique that can be used as an alternative. The results suggest that spectrophotometry methods can be more accurate than slurry nebulization ICP-MS for measuring the concentrations of n-TiO2 in wastewater containing NOM under low salt conditions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the use of a portable flow-through spectrophotometer for use in applications of wastewater treatment and environmental monitoring with real-time feedback of n-TiO2 concentrations. The ability to detect and monitor n-TiO2 will greatly assist in improving the understanding of hazards and risks that emerging nanomaterials pose to the environment and the public health.

29463797	<TITLE>Induction of ER and mitochondrial stress by the alkylphosphocholine erufosine in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.</TITLE>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in cell function and survival. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in ER stress and subsequent apoptosis. The alkylphosphocholine erufosine is a known Akt-mTOR inhibitor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study, we evaluate erufosine's role to induce ER and mitochondrial stress leading to autophagy, apoptosis, and ROS induction. The cellular toxicity of erufosine was determined in two OSCC cell lines and gene expression and enrichment analyses were performed. A positive enrichment of ER stress upon erufosine exposure was observed, which was verified at protein levels for the ER stress sensors and their downstream mediators. Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of the ER stress sensors PERK and XBP1 revealed their involvement into erufosine's cellular effects, including proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy induction. Autophagy was confirmed by increased acidic vacuoles and LC3-B levels. Upon erufosine exposure, calcium influx into the cytoplasm of the two OSCC cell lines was seen. Apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear staining, Annexin-V, and immunoblotting of caspases. The induction of mitochondrial stress upon erufosine exposure was predicted by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and shown by erufosine's effect on mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP, and ROS production in OSCC cells. These data show that ER and mitochondrial targeting by erufosine represents a new facet of its mechanism of action as well as a promising new framework in the treatment of head and neck cancers.

In vitro skin permeability studies were conducted using porcine ear skin. Histological analysis of the hairless mice skin samples after application of formulations was achieved with the routine haematoxylin/eosin technique. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using the AA-induced ear oedema mice model.|The formulation containing 25% C.O promoted the highest levels of in vitro Cxb permeation through pig ear skin, retention in the stratum corneum (SC) and epidermis/dermis of pig ear skin in vitro (~5-fold) and hairless mice skin in vivo (~2.0-fold), as compared with the control formulation. At 25%, C.O caused SC disorganization and increased cell infiltration and induced angiogenesis without clear signs of skin irritation. The formulation added to 25% C.O as adjuvant inhibited ear oedema and protein extravasation by 77.51 and 89.7%, respectively, and that it was, respectively, 2.0- and 3.4-fold more efficient than the commercial diethylammonium diclofenac cream gel to suppress these inflammatory parameters.|25% C.O is a potential penetration enhancer for lipophilic drugs like Cxb that can improve cutaneous drug penetration and its anti-inflammatory activity.

A retained cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) fragment was identified after transplantation in 49 of the 301 patients (16.2%) with CIED at baseline. Patients with retained fragments had leads with longer dwell times (median 2596 [1982, 3389] vs 1384 [610, 2202] days, P < .001), higher prevalence of previously abandoned leads (14.3% vs 2.8%, P = .003), and dual-coil defibrillator leads (98% vs 81%, P = .001) compared with patients without retained fragments. Five patients (10%) with retained CIED fragments underwent magnetic resonance imaging without adverse events. There was no difference in overall mortality between patients with and without CIED fragments (12% vs 11%, P = .81) Patients with retained fragments located in the superior vena cava had significantly higher fluoroscopic times (3.3 vs 2.9 minutes, P = .024) during subsequent endomyocardial biopsies. In a competing risk analysis, presence of a retained CIED fragment was associated with upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (sub hazard ratio [HR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-4.10, P = .014) but not bloodstream infection after adjusting for potential confounders. In summary, retained CIED fragments are common after heart transplantation, and are associated with longer radiation exposure during biopsy procedures and upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.

29634989	<TITLE>A mind cleared by walnut oil: The effects of polyunsaturated and saturated fat on extinction learning.</TITLE>The treatment of anxiety-based psychopathology often hinges upon extinction learning. Research in nutritional neuroscience has observed that the regular consumption of perilla oil (50% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) facilitates extinction learning in rats (Yamamoto et al., 1988). However, acute facilitation of extinction learning by oils rich in ALA has not been reported for rats or humans, though the acute consumption of rapeseed oil (10% ALA) has been observed to improve cognitive processing speed in humans (Jones, Sünram-Lea, & Wesnes, 2012). For this reason, the present laboratory work examined the effects of adding walnut oil (12% ALA) to a chocolate milkshake on the acquisition, generalization, and extinction of a fear-based prediction in young adults. It compared performance between subjects. The other participants consumed a similar milkshake with either an equicaloric amount of cream (saturated fat), or with no added fat (control).

29649857	<TITLE>Oxidative stress and hepatic injury induced in mice fed a Sarcocystis hirsuta cyst extract.</TITLE>We studied the toxic effects of a Sarcocystis hirsuta cyst extract fed to mice. Degenerative changes were found in mice gavage-fed fresh, frozen, and heat-treated S. hirsuta cyst extract. There were increases in the levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase as well as hepatic and brain malondialdehyde (MDA) levels along with concomitant decreases in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of mice receiving fresh and frozen S. hirsuta extracts. Gavage feeding of heat-treated S. hirsuta cyst extract had no effects on liver enzymes or brain MDA content, but the liver MDA level did increase. Mice in the heat-treated cyst group showed reduced CAT and SOD activities as well as increased hepatic MDA levels compared to those in the control group. These results indicate that an extract of S. hirsuta cyst can induce oxidative stress and hepatic injury, even after heat treatment.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29654830	<TITLE>Neuronal erythropoietin overexpression is protective against kanamycin-induced hearing loss in mice.</TITLE>Aminoglycosides have detrimental effects on the hair cells of the inner ear, yet these agents indisputably are one of the cornerstones in antibiotic therapy. Hence, there is a demand for strategies to prevent aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, which are not available today. In vitro data suggests that the pleiotropic growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) is neuroprotective against aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss. Here, we use a mouse model with EPO-overexpression in neuronal tissue to evaluate whether EPO could also in vivo protect from aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured in 12-weeks-old mice before and after treatment with kanamycin for 15 days, which resulted in both C57BL/6 and EPO-transgenic animals in a high-frequency hearing loss. However, ABR threshold shifts in EPO-transgenic mice were significantly lower than in C57BL/6 mice (mean difference in ABR threshold shift 13.6 dB at 32 kHz, 95% CI 3.8-23.4 dB, p = 0.003). Correspondingly, quantification of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons by immunofluorescence revealed that EPO-transgenic mice had a significantly lower hair cell and spiral ganglion neuron loss than C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, neuronal overexpression of EPO is protective against aminoglycoside-induce hearing loss, which is in accordance with its known neuroprotective effects in other organs, such as the eye or the brain.	Activation of EPO ameliorated a hearing loss disease model
29676852	<TITLE>Asp 58 modulates lens αA-crystallin oligomer formation and chaperone function.</TITLE>Senile cataract onset is caused by insolubilization of lens proteins. The lens crystallin protein family correctly orders the formation of homo- or hetero-oligomers in lens fiber cells. Because lens fiber cells do not divide, covalent post-translational modifications, such as isomerization of aspartate residues, accumulate with aging. Although many isomerization sites of αA-crystallin have been reported, their structural and functional contributions have never been identified. In this study, αA-crystallin was extracted from aged human lens and separated into each oligomeric state by size exclusion chromatography and electrophoresis. The novel combination methodology of in-solution/gel tryptic digestion with liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to evaluate the isomerization of Asp 58. The contributions of isomerization to assembly, solubility, and chaperone functions of αA-crystallin were estimated using a series of mutations of Asp 58 in αA-crystallin. The results indicated that the isomerization of Asp 58 depended on the oligomer size and age of the lens. The substitution of Asp 58 for hydrophobic residues increased αA-crystallin oligomer size and decreased solubility. All substitutions decreased the chaperone function of αA-crystallin for aggregates of bovine βL-crystallin and alcohol dehydrogenase. The data indicated that Asp 58 in αA-crystallin was critical for intermolecular interactions in the lens. Our results also suggested that LC-MS/MS-based isomerization analyses of in-gel-digested products could be useful for investigating the isomerization of Asp residues in oligomeric states. This method could also be used to analyze d/l ratios of amino acid residues in soluble protein aggregates.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

29696696	<TITLE>Engaging Stakeholders in the Development of an eHealth Intervention for Cancer Symptom Management for Rural Residents.</TITLE>Late-stage cancer diagnoses disproportionately occur in rural residents, frequently resulting in increased need for symptom management support with minimal access to these services. Oncology Associated Symptoms and Individualized Strategies (OASIS) is an eHealth symptom self-management intervention that was developed to provide cancer symptom self-management support and address this disparity.|To engage stakeholders about the symptom management needs and concerns of patients with advanced cancer living in rural areas.|A 3-phased, mixed-methods design was used to (1) assess stakeholder needs and opinions; (2) develop a symptom self-management website; and (3) obtain usability feedback from potential users. Interviews with stakeholders (patients and clinic staff) from rural areas using a descriptive qualitative approach were analyzed; cross-cutting themes were identified; a symptom management web application was developed; and stakeholders completed a 12-item usability survey about the web application.|Patients (n = 16) and clinical staff (n = 10) participated in phase 1. Three major themes were identified: "symptom experience," "symptom management," and "technology." Through an iterative process using these results and evidence from the literature, the OASIS web application was developed. Usability testing with N = 126 stakeholders demonstrated that the web application is easy to use, contains relevant content, and has pleasing graphics. No differences were found among patients, family/friends, and staff. Both frequent and infrequent internet users positively evaluated the web application.  CONCLUSIONS: Rural stakeholders report significant symptom management needs, are interested in eHealth technologies, and perceived OASIS positively. Future research is needed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of OASIS.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29708631	<TITLE>Comparative proteomic analysis of hypothalamus tissue from Huoyan geese between pre-laying period and laying period using an iTRAQ-based approach.</TITLE>The hypothalamus plays a central role in controlling poultry endocrine and reproductive activities. So far there is limited information focused on the proteome profiles of the hypothalamus from geese during different stages of the egg-laying cycle. In order to identify proteins regulating the egg-laying process of Huoyan geese, we investigated the proteome profiles of the hypothalamus from Huoyan geese during the laying period and pre-laying period by applying an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic technology. A total number of 3,337 were identified and quantified, of which 18 were significantly up-regulated and 16 were significantly down-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins were subjected to bioinformatics analyses based on the Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. Some of these were revealed to be involved in hormone and neurotransmitter secretion, exocytosis, calcium ion transport and synaptic transmission. Subsequently, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, complexin-1 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 3 were confirmed at the messenger RNA level using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Then, the abundance change of these proteins was verified further using Western blotting analysis. These data may aid in elucidating the molecular mechanism of higher laying performance in Huoyan geese.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29739411	<TITLE>Locum physicians' professional ethos: a qualitative interview study from Germany.</TITLE>In contrast to other countries, the appearance of locum physicians as independent contractors constitutes a rather new phenomenon in the German health care system and emerged out of a growing economization and shortage of medical staff in the hospital sector. Locums are a special type of self-employed professionals who are only temporally embedded in organisational contexts of hospitals, and this might have consequences for their professional practice. Therefore, questions arise regarding how locums perceive their ethical duties as medical professionals.|In this first qualitative study on German locum physicians, the locums' own perspective is complemented by the viewpoint of permanently employed physician colleagues. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2014 to explore the professional practice of locum physicians from both groups' perspectives with respect to doctor-patient-relationship, cooperation with colleagues and physicians' role in society. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis, including a deductive application and an inductive development of codes. The results were related to key tenets of medical professionalism with respect to the question: how far do locums fulfil their ethical duties towards patients, colleagues and the society?|The study indicates that although ethical requirements are met broadly, difficulties remain with respect to close doctor-patient contact and the sustainability of hiring locums as a remedy in times of staff shortage.|Further qualitative and quantitative research on locum physicians' professional practice, including patient perspectives and economic health care system analyses, is needed to better understand the ethical impact of hiring independent contractors in the hospital sector.

29743500	<TITLE>Clinical evaluation of silicone gel in the treatment of cleft lip scars.</TITLE>Upper lip scars are at risk of hypertrophy. Our center therefore uses microporous tape and silicone sheeting for postoperative scar care following cleft lip repair. However, some babies have previously ingested their silicone sheeting, which has the potential for respiratory compromise or gastrointestinal obstruction. Self-dry silicone gel is reportedly also effective for preventing hypertrophic scars. Hence, we sought to test whether silicone gel, which cannot be ingested whole, might be non-inferior to silicone sheeting for controlling against upper lip scar hypertrophy. This was a mixed prospective and retrospective case-controlled clinical trial involving patients undergoing unilateral cleft lip repair, 29 of whom received standard postoperative silicone sheeting (control group) and another 33 age-matched consecutive patients who received self-dry silicone instead. The Vancouver scar scale, visual analogue scale and photographically assessed scar width assessments were the same in both groups at six months after surgery. In conclusion, silicone gel appears to be non-inferior to silicone sheeting for postoperative care of upper lip scars as judged by scar quality at six months, but silicone sheeting has the safety disadvantage that it can be swallowed whole by babies. It is thus recommended that silicone gel be used for upper lip scar management in babies.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

HER-2/neu is one of the most important amplified oncogene in breast cancer. The amplification of HER-2 is correlated with decreased survival, metastasis, and early recurrence. The amplification of HER-2/neu gene and synthesis of the protein are reported in 10%-34% of breast cancer cases associated with tumor size, advanced tumor stage, high-grade tumor, young age at diagnosis, absence of steroid hormone receptor, and lymph node involvement.|Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods are options to evaluate HER-2 expression. The current study aimed at identifying the correlation between FISH and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in measuring HER-2 expression.|The study investigated the performance of the real-time PCR as measured against FISH method in IHC +2 borderline cases. In a total of 120 IHC 2+ samples, 58.3% were negative and 41.6% positive for HER-2 gene, confirmed by FISH as a gold standard method. The real-time PCR ratio was <1.8 for a majority (82.8%) of the tumor samples with unamplified HER-2 gene by FISH as a gold standard assay.|Despite the fact that real-time PCR is a promising method to evaluate HER-2 over expression and a supplementary array to FISH, according to the results of the present study it cannot be utilized instead of gold standard techniques; therefore, additional studies should be carried out to appraise the value of this method to evaluate HER-2 over expression.

29783148	<TITLE>Comparative study of six sequential spectrophotometric methods for quantification and separation of ribavirin, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir: An application on Laboratory prepared mixture, pharmaceutical preparations, spiked human urine, spiked human plasma, and dissolution test.</TITLE>In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, six novel, simple and precise sequential spectrophotometric methods were developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of Ribavirin (RIB), Sofosbuvir (SOF), and Daclatasvir (DAC) in their mixture without prior separation steps. These drugs are described as co-administered for treatment of Hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is the cause of hepatitis C and some cancers such as liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) and lymphomas in humans. These techniques consisted of several sequential steps using zero, ratio and/or derivative spectra. DAC was first determined through direct spectrophotometry at 313.7 nm without any interference of the other two drugs while RIB and SOF can be determined after ratio subtraction through five methods; Ratio difference spectrophotometric method, successive derivative ratio method, constant center, isoabsorptive method at 238.8 nm, and mean centering of the ratio spectra (MCR) at 224 nm and 258 nm for RIB and SOF, respectively. The calibration curve is linear over the concentration ranges of (6-42), (10-70) and (4-16) μg/mL for RIB, SOF, and DAC, respectively. This method was successfully applied to commercial pharmaceutical preparation of the drugs, spiked human urine, and spiked human plasma. The above methods are very simple methods that were developed for the simultaneous determination of binary and ternary mixtures and so enhance signal-to-noise ratio. The method has been successfully applied to the simultaneous analysis of RIB, SOF, and DAC in laboratory prepared mixtures. The obtained results are statistically compared with those obtained by the official or reported methods, showing no significant difference with respect to accuracy and precision at p = 0.05.

29795737	<TITLE>Practices, Perceived Benefits, and Barriers to Resistance Training Among Women Enrolled in College.</TITLE>The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has recommended that resistance training be performed at least twice per week, with 8-12 repetitions of 8-10 exercises targeting all major muscle groups (1). However, Kruger, Carlson, and Kohl (18) reported that women were participating less than the U.S. population on the whole, as only 20% of women were engaging in resistance training two or more times per week. In order to better understand why only 1 in 5 women participate regularly in this form of physical activity, this study investigated current resistance training practices, perceived benefits, and barriers to resistance training among college women. One-hundred and sixteen women college students from a large, public, Midwestern university participated in this study. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to identify the strongest predictors of resistance training behaviors. The predictors in the regression model included demographic characteristics in block one, perceived barriers to resistance training in block two, and perceived benefits of resistance training in block three. Results indicated that the level of perceived "time/effort" barriers significantly predicted resistance training behavior. Findings in this area may help researchers, university recreation programmers, personal trainers, and other health and fitness professionals better understand the attitudes and actions of college women regarding resistance training, toward the goal of promoting fitness center environments that college women find more inviting.

There is a significant minority of statin-treated patients who are more susceptible to occasionally serious side effects that may increase morbidity and lead to compliance problems or the discontinuation of therapy. This review addresses the question of whether genetics can provide meaningful insights into the risk of statin side effects or therapy success.|The use of genome-wide association studies has significantly reduced the number of predictive genetic markers for statin effects, and the isolated effect of the surviving markers is low; more promising are approaches to stratify patients with genetic risk scores. Patients reveal a pronounced individual response to the administration of statins. The idea of being able to adequately describe this variability with single genetic markers has failed, genetic risk scores will be the method of choice.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Properly designed synthetic procedures were used to obtain copolymers with high purity and without protection/deprotection steps in agreement with the principles of green chemistry and industrial sustainability. The use of saccharide derivatives as monomers allowed products to be obtained that showed high affinity and compatibility for the cellulosic substrates, like paper or wood, and that were suitable for applications like adhesion or consolidation in the field of cultural heritage. All reaction products were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies and SEC analyses, while thermal properties were evaluated by DSC analyses.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
29932184	<TITLE>Structure of supramolecular astaxanthin aggregates revealed by molecular dynamics and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy.</TITLE>Biomolecular aggregation is omnipresent in nature and important for metabolic processes or in medical treatment; however, the phenomenon is rather difficult to predict or understand on the basis of computational models. Recently, we found that electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy and closely related resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) are extremely sensitive to the aggregation mechanism and structure of the astaxanthin dye. In the present study, molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum chemical (QC) computations (ZIndo/S, TDDFT) are used to link the aggregate structure with ECD spectral shapes. Realistic absorption and ECD intensities were obtained and the simulations reproduced many trends observed experimentally, such as the prevalent sign pattern and dependence of the aggregate structure on the solvent type. The computationally cheaper ZIndo/S method provided results very similar to those obtained by TDDFT. In the future, the accuracy of the combined MD/QC methodology of spectra interpretation should be improved to provide more detailed information on astaxanthin aggregates and similar macromolecular systems.

Psychiatric nurses (PNs) find it difficult to render quality care to MHCUs who are threatening them and also challenging their authority in a forensic unit. Forensic mental health care practitioners may be challenged to engage authentically with MHCUs who constitute a risk to their personal safety or who have committed acts the practitioner finds morally disturbing. There is a need to facilitate the mental health of PNs in a forensic unit to manage hostile behaviour constructively.|The objective of this article is to describe the process that was followed in developing, implementing and evaluating a model that could be used as a framework of reference to facilitate the mental health of PNs in a forensic unit to manage hostile behaviour constructively.|A theory-generative, qualitative, exploratory descriptive and contextual study design was used to develop the model. The steps of the process entailed the identification of the central concept, the definition of the central concept and other essential criteria and the classification of the central and related concepts. The model was then described and evaluated.|The central concept was identified as the 'facilitation of empowerment of PNs to manage hostility in a constructive manner', defined, classified and then described and evaluated.|The model as framework of reference could assist PNs in managing hostility in a forensic unit constructively.

29952388	<TITLE>Microrheology of DNA hydrogel gelling and melting on cooling.</TITLE>We present systematic characterisation by means of dynamic light scattering and particle tracking techniques of the viscosity and of the linear viscoelastic moduli, G'(ω) and G''(ω), for two different DNA hydrogels. These thermoreversible systems are composed of tetravalent DNA-made nanostars whose sticky sequence is designed to provide controlled interparticle bonding. While the first system forms a gel on cooling, the second one has been programmed to behave as a re-entrant gel, turning again to a fluid solution at low temperature. The frequency-dependent viscous and storage moduli and the viscosity reveal the different viscoelastic behavior of the two DNA hydrogels. Our results show how little variations in the design of the DNA sequences allow tuning of the mechanical response of these biocompatible all-DNA materials.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30042162	<TITLE>Diastereomerically Pure 6R- and 6S-3'-Aza-2'-18F-Fluoro-5-Methyltetrahydrofolates Show Unprecedentedly High Uptake in Folate Receptor-Positive KB Tumors.</TITLE>The aim of this study was to develop the radiosyntheses of diastereomerically pure 6R- and 6S-3'-aza-2'-18F-fluoro-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) (6R-18F-1 and 6S-18F-1) using the integrated approach and to compare the in vitro and in vivo performance characteristics of both radioligands with the previously reported 3'-aza-2'-18F-fluorofolic acid tracer (18F-2), the oxidized form. Methods: 6R-18F-1, 6S-18F-1, and 18F-2 were radiolabeled with 18F using aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. In vitro cell uptake studies and binding affinity assays were performed using folate receptor (FR)-α-expressing KB cells. PET/CT imaging and biodistribution experiments were performed with KB tumor-bearing mice. Results: Reference compounds 6R-1 and 6S-1 were obtained after acidic hydrolysis of the corresponding protected intermediates 6R-3 and 6S-3 in high chemical yields (81%-87%) and chemical purities of more than 95%. 6R-18F-1, 6S-18F-1, and 18F-2 were obtained after a 2-step radiosynthetic procedure in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of up to 5% and molar radioactivities ranging from 20 to 250 GBq/μmol. In vitro binding affinity studies using FR-α-positive KB cells gave half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 27.1 ± 3.7 and 23.8 ± 4.0 nM for 6R-1 and 6S-1, respectively, which were higher than for the previously reported 3'-aza-2'-fluorofolic acid 2 (1.4 ± 0.5 nM). Comparably high cell uptake values in FR-α-expressing KB cells were found for all 3 radiofolates. In biodistribution studies, exceptionally high KB tumor uptake value of over 32% injected activity per gram of tissue for both 6R-18F-1 and 6S-18F-1 was observed at 180 min after injection, whereas for 18F-2 only 15% injected activity per gram was found in the KB tumors. Radioactivity uptake in the kidneys, liver, salivary glands, and spleen was substantially different for the 6R- and 6S-diastereoisomers and 18F-2 Excellent KB tumor visualization was found in PET/CT images with 6R-18F-1 and 6S-18F-1, both of which outperformed the corresponding oxidized 18F-2. Conclusion: We have successfully radiolabeled 6R- and 6S-3'-aza-2'-18F-fluoro-5-MTHF with 18F using the integrated approach. Our results suggest that both 6R- and 6S-3'-aza-2'-18F-fluoro-5-MTHF are promising reduced radiofolates for imaging FR-α-expressing cancers.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Nutrition assessment is an important step in recognizing malnutrition; however, it is not always performed using consistent parameters.|A survey among U.S. American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) members was conducted to collect data on nutrition assessment parameters used in hospitals and to establish how facilities use their electronic health record (EHR) to permit data retrieval and outcome reporting.|The survey was developed by the ASPEN Malnutrition Committee and was sent to 5487 U.S. ASPEN members, with 489 responding for a 9% response rate. Ninety-eight percent of adult and 93% of pediatric respondents indicated a registered dietitian completed the nutrition assessment following a positive nutrition screen. Variables most frequently used among adult respondents included usual body weight, ideal body weight, and body mass index. Among pediatric respondents, weight-for-age and height-for-age percentiles and length/height-for-age percentile were most frequently used. Both adult and pediatric respondents indicated use of physical assessment parameters, including muscle and fat loss and skin assessment. Eighty-seven percent of adult and 77% of pediatric respondents indicated they are using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and ASPEN Consensus Malnutrition Characteristics for Adult and Pediatric Malnutrition, respectively. Overall, 97% of respondents indicated nutrition assessment documentation was completed via an EHR.

30091270	<TITLE>Competitive control of endoglucanase gene engXCA expression in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris by the global transcriptional regulators HpaR1 and Clp.</TITLE>Transcriptional regulators are key players in pathways that allow bacteria to alter gene expression in response to environmental conditions. However, work to understand how such transcriptional regulatory networks interact in bacterial plant pathogens is limited. Here, in the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris, we demonstrate that the global transcriptional regulator HpaR1 influences many of the same genes as another global regulator Clp, including the engXCA gene that encodes extracellular endoglucanase. We demonstrate that HpaR1 facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase to the engXCA promoter. In addition, we show that HpaR1 binds directly to the engXCA promoter. Furthermore, our in vitro tests characterize two binding sites for Clp within the engXCA promoter. Interestingly, one of these sites overlaps with the HpaR1 binding site. Mobility shift assays reveal that HpaR1 has greater affinity for binding to the engXCA promoter. This observation is supported by promoter activity assays, which show that the engXCA expression level is lower when both HpaR1 and Clp are present together, rather than alone. The data also reveal that HpaR1 and Clp activate engXCA gene expression by binding directly to its promoter. This transcriptional activation is modulated as both regulators compete to bind to overlapping sites on the engXCA promoter. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that this mechanism may be used broadly in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and is probably widespread in Xanthomonads and, potentially, other bacteria. Taken together, these data support a novel mechanism of competitive activation by two global regulators of virulence gene expression in Xcc which is probably widespread in Xanthomonads and, potentially, other bacteria.

30098640	<TITLE>Clothing comfort during physical exercise - Determining the critical factors.</TITLE>Clothing comfort is determined by multiple material and design factors. Wetness at the skin-clothing interface mainly impacts wear comfort. The current study investigated the combined effect of fabric contact area, fabric absolute sweat content and fabric moisture saturation percentage on wetness and stickiness sensations, during exercise. Moreover, factors causing wear (dis)comfort during exercise were identified. Higher fabric saturation percentage induced greater stickiness sensation, despite lower fabric contact area and absolute sweat content (typically associated with lower stickiness). Wetness perception did not change between fabrics with different saturation percentages, contact areas and sweat contents. Therefore, fabric saturation percentage mainly affects stickiness sensation of wet fabrics, overruling the impact of fabric contact area and absolute sweat content. No overall model of wear discomfort across all data could be developed, however, models for different time points were produced, with texture and stickiness sensations being the best predictors of wear discomfort at baseline and during exercise, respectively. This suggests that the factors determining clothing (dis)comfort are dynamics and alter importance during exercise activity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

A reliable method to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral ACS is lacking.|Evaluate the use of adrenal venous sampling (AVS) to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral ACS.|This was a prospective study of AVS in patients with adrenal tumors who received a diagnosis of ACS or adrenal Cushing syndrome (CS). Unilateral secretion was defined as >2.3-fold difference in cortisol levels between the two adrenal veins. Metanephrine levels were used to ascertain correct catheter position. Results were correlated with findings on CT and iodine-131-cholesterol scintigraphy.|Thirty-nine patients underwent AVS; there were no complications. The procedure was inconclusive in six patients and repeated with success in one, giving a success rate of 85%, and leaving 34 procedures for evaluation (adrenal CS, n = 2; ACS, n = 32). Of 14 patients with bilateral tumors, 10 had bilateral and 4 had unilateral overproduction. Of 20 patients with unilateral tumors, 11 had lateralization to the side of the tumor and the remaining had bilateral secretion. Cholesterol scintigraphy findings were concordant with those of AVS in 13 of 18 cases (72%) and discordant in 5 (28%).|Laterality of ACS does not always correspond to findings on CT images. AVS is a safe and valuable tool for differentiation between unilateral and bilateral cortisol secretion and should be considered when operative treatment of ACS is a possibility.

30153261	<TITLE>Effects of carbon-based nanomaterials on seed germination, biomass accumulation and salt stress response of bioenergy crops.</TITLE>Bioenergy crops are an attractive option for use in energy production. A good plant candidate for bioenergy applications should produce a high amount of biomass and resist harsh environmental conditions. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) have been described as promising seed germination and plant growth regulators. In this paper, we tested the impact of two CBNs: graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on germination and biomass production of two major bioenergy crops (sorghum and switchgrass). The application of graphene and CNTs increased the germination rate of switchgrass seeds and led to an early germination of sorghum seeds. The exposure of switchgrass to graphene (200 mg/l) resulted in a 28% increase of total biomass produced compared to untreated plants. We tested the impact of CBNs on bioenergy crops under salt stress conditions and discovered that CBNs can significantly reduce symptoms of salt stress imposed by the addition of NaCl into the growth medium. Using an ion selective electrode, we demonstrated that the concentration of Na+ ions in NaCl solution can be significantly decreased by the addition of CNTs to the salt solution. Our data confirmed the potential of CBNs as plant growth regulators for non-food crops and demonstrated the role of CBNs in the protection of plants against salt stress by desalination of saline growth medium.

30153496	<TITLE>Is there an "antisocial" cerebellum? Evidence from disorders other than autism characterized by abnormal social behaviours.</TITLE>The cerebellum is a hindbrain structure which involvement in functions not related to motor control and planning is being increasingly recognized in the last decades. Studies on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have reported cerebellar involvement on these conditions characterized by social deficits and repetitive motor behavior patterns. Although such an involvement hints at a possible cerebellar participation in the social domain, the fact that ASD patients present both social and motor deficits impedes drawing any firm conclusion regarding cerebellar involvement in pathological social behaviours, probably influenced by the classical view of the cerebellum as a purely "motor" brain structure. Here, we suggest the cerebellum can be a key node for the production and control of normal and particularly aberrant social behaviours, as indicated by its involvement in other neuropsychiatric disorders which main symptom is deregulated social behaviour. Therefore, in this work, we briefly review cerebellar involvement in social behavior in rodent models, followed by discussing the findings linking the cerebellum to those other psychiatric conditions characterized by defective social behaviours. Finally, possible commonalities between the studies and putative underlying impaired functions will be discussed and experimental approaches both in patients and experimental animals will also be proposed, aimed at stimulating research on the role of the cerebellum in social behaviours and disorders characterized by social impairments, which, if successful, will definitely help reinforcing the proposed cerebellar involvement in the social domain.

30158333	<TITLE>Importance of bronchoscopic lung volume reduction coil therapy in potential candidates for lung transplantation.</TITLE>Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) coil treatment is a alternative and promising treatment modality for selected severe emphysema patients. The main indication of this treatment modality is a forced expiration volume in one second (FEV1) of 15-45% and a residual volume (RV) > 175%. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of BLVR coil therapy in patients with end-stage emphysema who were potential candidates for lung transplantation and had FEV1 values less than 25%. Twenty-one patients who underwent bilateral BLVR coil therapy between September 2013 and May 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the changes in clinical and laboratory parameters at the baseline and 12 months after the treatment. Twelve months after the bilateral BLVR coil treatment, we observed an average increase in FEV1 (110 mL and 4.6%), a decrease in residual volume (660 mL and 33%), and an increase in 6-minute walk tests (67 m). The most common complications were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (47.6%) and pneumonia (23.8%). All patients tolerated the general anesthesia and procedure very well. BLVR coil therapy is safe and effective in patients with end-stage emphysema, who are potential candidates for lung transplantation within a short to medium period. The complication rates of this treatment were not different from those of the other coil treatments, and the improvements in the clinical parameters after the treatment resulted in gaining time for lung transplantation. Future research for evaluating the long-term efficacy of BLVR coil therapy in these patients is essential.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30195693	<TITLE>Role of water on the H-abstraction from methanol by ClO.</TITLE>The influence of a single water molecule on the reaction mechanism and kinetics of hydrogen abstraction from methanol (CH3OH) by the ClO radical has been investigated using ab initio calculations. The reaction proceeds through two channels: abstraction of the hydroxyl H-atom and methyl H-atom of CH3OH by ClO, leading to the formation of CH3O+HOCl (+H2O) and CH2OH+HOCl (+H2O), respectively. In both cases, pre- and post-reactive complexes were located at the entrance and exit channel on the potential energy surfaces. Results indicate that the formation of CH2OH+HOCl (+H2O) is predominant over the formation of CH3O+HOCl (+H2O), with ambient rate constants of 3.07×10-19 and 3.01×10-23cm3/(molecule·sec), respectively, for the reaction without water. Over the temperature range 216.7-298.2K, the presence of water is seen to effectively lower the rate constants for the most favorable pathways by 4-6 orders of magnitude in both cases. It is therefore concluded that water plays an inhibitive role on the CH3OH+ClO reaction under tropospheric conditions.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30246850	<TITLE>Arrays of highly complex noble metal nanostructures using nanoimprint lithography in combination with liquid-phase epitaxy.</TITLE>Current best-practice lithographic techniques are unable to meet the functional requirements needed to enable on-chip plasmonic devices capable of fully exploiting nanostructure properties reliant on a tailored nanostructure size, composition, architecture, crystallinity, and placement. As a consequence, numerous nanofabrication methods have emerged that address various weaknesses, but none have, as of yet, demonstrated a large-area processing route capable of defining organized surfaces of nanostructures with the architectural diversity and complexity that is routinely displayed in colloidal syntheses. Here, a hybrid fabrication strategy is demonstrated in which nanoimprint lithography is combined with templated dewetting and liquid-phase syntheses that is able to realize periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures over square centimeter areas. The process is inexpensive, can be carried out on a benchtop, and requires modest levels of instrumentation. Demonstrated are three fabrication schemes yielding arrays of core-shell, core-void-shell, and core-void-nanoframe structures using liquid-phase syntheses involving heteroepitaxial deposition, galvanic replacement, and dealloying. With the field of nanotechnology being increasingly reliant on the engineering of desirable physicochemical responses through architectural control, the fabrication strategy provides a platform for advancing devices reliant on addressable arrays or the collective response from an ensemble of identical nanostructures.

30256707	<TITLE>Abl2 is recruited to ventral actin waves through cytoskeletal interactions to promote lamellipodium extension.</TITLE>Abl family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases regulate changes in cell shape and migration. Abl2 localizes to dynamic actin-rich protrusions, such as lamellipodia in fibroblasts and dendritic spines in neurons. Abl2 interactions with cortactin, an actin filament stabilizer, are crucial for the formation and stability of actin-rich structures, but Abl2:cortactin-positive structures have not been characterized with high spatiotemporal resolution in cells. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that Abl2 colocalizes with cortactin at wave-like structures within lamellum and lamellipodium tips. Abl2 and cortactin within waves are focal and transient, extend to the outer edge of lamella, and serve as the base for lamellipodia protrusions. Abl2-positive foci colocalize with integrin β3 and paxillin, adhesive markers of the lamellum-lamellipodium interface. Cortactin-positive waves still form in Abl2 knockout cells, but the lamellipodium size is significantly reduced. This deficiency is restored following Abl2 reexpression. Complementation analyses revealed that the Abl2 C-terminal half, which contains domains that bind actin and microtubules, is necessary and sufficient for recruitment to the wave-like structures and to support normal lamellipodium size, while the kinase domain-containing N-terminal half does not impact lamellipodium size. Together, this work demonstrates that Abl2 is recruited with cortactin to actin waves through cytoskeletal interactions to promote lamellipodium extension.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30258469	<TITLE>Consumption of regular-fat vs reduced-fat cheese reveals gender-specific changes in LDL particle size - a randomized controlled trial.</TITLE>Regular-fat cheese does not seem to increase low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations compared to reduced-fat cheese. However, plasma LDL-C concentrations do not reflect levels and size of LDL particles, which might be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk.|The aim was to compare the effects of regular-fat cheese vs reduced-fat cheese and carbohydrate-rich foods on LDL particle size distribution in adults with ≥ 2 metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. The study was part of a 12 weeks' randomized controlled trial in which subjects had been randomly allocated to 1 of 3 intervention groups; regular-fat cheese (REG), reduced-fat cheese (RED) or a no-cheese/carbohydrate (CHO) group. Subjects in the REG and RED groups consumed 80 g cheese/d per 10 MJ, whereas subjects in the CHO consumed bread and jam corresponding to 90 g/d and 25 g/d per 10 MJ, respectively. Fasting blood samples at wk. 0 (baseline) and wk. 12 were analyzed for LDL particle size distribution and cholesterol content using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.|A total of 85 subjects [mean ± SD age: 54.0 ± 12.8 y; BMI: 28.7 ± 3.6 kg/m2] completed the study. Overall, regular-fat cheese did not impact lipoprotein particle number and size differently than reduced-fat cheese. In men (n = 23), the REG diet decreased total LDL particle number (LDL-P, - 223.2 ± 91.1 nmol/l, P = 0.01) compared with the RED diet. The reduction was primarily in the medium-sized LDL fraction (- 128.5 ± 51.8 nmol/l, P = 0.01). In women (n = 62), the REG diet increased the concentration of cholesterol in the small high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles compared with the CHO diet (2.9 ± 1.0 mg/dl, P = 0.006).|Overall, regular-fat cheese did not alter LDL particle size distribution compared to reduced-fat cheese after a 12 wk. intervention in subjects with ≥2 MetS risk factors. However, our results suggest that lipoprotein response to cheese intake is gender-specific. This warrants further investigation.|This trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT0261471.

30270078	<TITLE>Establishing a national screening programme for familial hypercholesterolaemia in Lithuania.</TITLE>Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a widely underdiagnosed genetic disorder characterized by severely elevated levels of serum cholesterol and associated with premature mortality. Screening programmes and registries have been established worldwide to find and monitor patients with FH. The aim of this paper was to describe the approaches currently applied to identify patients with possible FH in Lithuania.|An electronic extraction tool was applied to the medical records of 92,373 subjects evaluated in primary care settings from 2009 to 2016, 1714 secondary prevention patients with early onset (<50 years) coronary heart disease (CHD) treated in tertiary care hospital from 2005 to 2016 and high-risk subjects in specialized cardiovascular prevention units. The electronic databases were screened for likely FH phenotype, which was described simply as LDL-C ≥6.5 mmol/l.|Likely FH phenotype was observed in 1385 (1.5%) middle-aged Lithuanians, 290 (16.9%) people with premature CHD and 330 adults from high-risk subjects referred to specialized cardiovascular prevention units. A total of 2005 patients with likely phenotypic FH were included in the Lithuanian FH screening programme, covering about 15% of estimated FH cases in Lithuania.|Screening for extremely elevated LDL-C levels in primary prevention database and additional enrolment of patients with premature CVD as well as high-risk subjects may be a valid way to set up a national FH screening programme. It is crucially important to identify and initiate the treatment of FH patients as early as possible to reduce high cardiovascular mortality in these patients.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30315793	<TITLE>Surgical Outcomes in Behcet's Disease Patients With Severe Aortic Regurgitation.</TITLE>An optimal treatment for aortic regurgitation in Behcet's disease has not been established. We investigated the effect of operative technique, prosthetic material, and immunomodulation therapy on surgical outcomes.|In this study, 23 patients with Behcet's disease surgically treated for aortic regurgitation were assessed. Significant postoperative events were defined as death, aortic valve or graft-related problem(s), infective endocarditis, disabling stroke, and aortic valve or root reoperation. Surgical procedures were classified as isolated aortic valve replacement, bioprosthetic root replacement, and mechanical root replacement. Allograft root replacements were included in the bioprosthetic root replacement group.|A total of 40 operations, including 39 aortic valve or root surgeries and 1 orthotopic heart transplantation, were performed on patients confirmed with Behcet's disease. However, the study only reviewed 35 of the 40 cases (4 cases with inadequately documented medical records and 1 heart transplantation case were excluded). Significant adverse events occurred in 8 of 11 (73%) isolated aortic valve replacement, 9 of 12 (75%) bioprosthetic root replacement (5 xenografts and 7 allografts), and 4 of 12 (33%) mechanical root replacement cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that the 1-month postdischarge C-reactive protein level and operative age were independent predictive factors for postoperative event-free survival. Mechanical root replacement was identified as the most significant predictive factor leading to positive outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.147; 95% confidence interval, 0.028 to 0.766; p = 0.023).|The findings suggest that mechanical root replacement combined with a low postoperative C-reactive protein level maintained through adjunctive immunomodulation therapy may lead to optimal surgical outcomes in Behcet's disease associated with severe aortic regurgitation.

30326796	<TITLE>Dietary carotenoids and cognitive function among US adults, NHANES 2011-2014.</TITLE>Objectives: Dietary carotenoids may limit neuronal damage from free radicals, potentially serving as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. We examined intake of lutein and zeaxanthin (L and Z) in relation to cognitive performance among 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants aged ≥60 years. Methods: L and Z intake from foods and supplements was estimated from two non-consecutive 24-hour diet recalls. Outcomes included the CERAD Word Learning sub-test score, Animal Fluency test score, and Digit Symbol Substitution test score. Regression models were adjusted for survey design variables, year, sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, family income, education, alcohol, and smoking. Results: Among the 2796 participants, higher dietary intake of L and Z was associated with higher score on each test. For example, the highest quartile of L and Z intake was associated with a 2.52 point increase (SE=0.86 points, P=0.01) on the digit symbol score test, compared with the lowest quartile. There were differences by race/ethnicity, with positive associations generally stronger for Black compared to white participants. Discussion: Further research from longitudinal studies is needed, but increasing L and Z intake may help to prevent or slow cognitive decline.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30422309	<TITLE>Colonization of preterm gnotobiotic piglets with probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and its interference with Salmonella Typhimurium.</TITLE>A balanced microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a prerequisite for a healthy host. The GIT microbiota in preterm infants is determined by the method of delivery and nutrition. Probiotics can improve the GIT microbiota balance and suitable animal models are required to verify their harmlessness. Preterm gnotobiotic piglets were colonized with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) to evaluate its safety and possible protective action against infection with an enteric pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). Clinical signs (anorexia, somnolence, fever and diarrhea), bacterial interference and translocation, intestinal histopathology, transcriptions of claudin-1, occludin and interferon (IFN)-γ, intestinal and systemic protein levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-12/23 p40 and IFN-γ were compared among (i) germ-free, (ii) LGG-colonized, (iii) ST-infected and (iv) LGG-colonized and subsequently ST-infected piglets for 24 h. Both LGG and ST-colonized the GIT; LGG translocated in some cases into mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen but did not cause bacteremia and clinical changes. ST caused clinical signs of gastroenteritis, translocated into mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, liver and blood, increased claudin-1 and IFN-γ transcriptions, but decreased occludin transcription and increased local and systemic levels of IL-8 and IL-12/23 p40. Previous colonization with LGG reduced ST colonization in the jejunum and translocation into the liver, spleen and blood. It partially ameliorated histopathological changes in the intestine, reduced IL-8 levels in the jejunum and plasma and IL-12/23 p40 in the jejunum. The preterm gnotobiotic piglet model of the vulnerable preterm immunocompromised infant is useful to verify the safety of probiotics and evaluate their protective effect.

30429052	<TITLE>P2X7 receptor-mediated leukocyte recruitment and Porphyromonas gingivalis clearance requires IL-1β production and autocrine IL-1 receptor activation.</TITLE>The Gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with periodontitis. We previously demonstrated that P2X7 receptor activation by extracellular ATP (eATP) triggers elimination of intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania amazonensis, Toxoplasma gondii and Chlamydia trachomatis. We also showed that eATP-induced IL-1β secretion via the P2X7 receptor is impaired by P. gingivalis fimbriae. Furthermore, enhanced P2X7 receptor expression was detected in the maxilla of P. gingivalis-orally infected mice as well as in human periodontitis patients. Here, we examined the effect of P2X7-, caspase-1/11- and IL-1 receptor-mediated responses during P. gingivalis infection. P2X7 receptor played a large role in controlling P. gingivalis infection and P. gingivalis-induced recruitment of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils. In addition, IL-1β secretion was detected at different time points only when P2X7 receptor was expressed and in the presence of eATP treatment ex vivo. Activation of P2X7 receptor and IL-1 receptor by eATP and IL-1β, respectively, promoted P. gingivalis elimination in macrophages. Interestingly, eATP-induced P. gingivalis killing was inhibited by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), consistent with autocrine activation of the IL-1 receptor for P. gingivalis elimination. In vivo, caspase-1/11 and IL-1 receptor were also required for bacterial clearance, leukocyte recruitment and IL-1β production after P. gingivalis infection. Our data demonstrate that the P2X7-IL-1 receptor axis activation is required for effective innate immune responses against P. gingivalis infection.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30457472	<TITLE>Antiobesity Effect of Fermented Chokeberry Extract in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</TITLE>Black-fruited chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa), growing mainly in the Central and Eastern European countries, have health benefits due to the high concentrations of polyphenolic compounds. However, a strong bitter taste of chokeberries limits its usage as functional food. We hypothesized that the fermented A. melanocarpa with a reduced bitter taste would improve insulin sensitivity and/or ameliorate weight gain induced by high-fat diet (HFD) in male C57BL/6J mice. The mice were administered with HFD together with the 100 mg/kg of natural A. melanocarpa (T1) or the fermented A. melanocarpa (T2) for 8 weeks. The treatment with T2 (100 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) markedly attenuated the weight gain and the increase in serum triglyceride level induced by HFD. The T2-treated group had better glucose tolerance and higher insulin sensitivity as measured by oral glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test in comparison to the T1-treated group. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the main constituents of T2 were cyanidin-3-xyloside and 1-(3',4'-dihydroxycinnamoyl)cyclopenta-2,3-diol, and the content of cyanidin glycosides (3-glucoside, 3-xyloside) was significantly reduced during the fermentation process. From the above results, we postulated that antiobesity effect of black chokeberry was not closely correlated with the cyanidin content. Fermented chokeberry might be a viable dietary supplement rich in bioactive compounds useful in preventing obesity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We predicted utilization in 2012 using multivariable regression models and data available in 2011 administrative records.|Among 2,269,475 nonelderly Massachusetts residents, 40% had public insurance. Among public insurees, PCS ED use was higher than for private (mean, 36.5 vs. 9.0 per 100 persons; adjusted risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence limits, 2.49-2.56), while having any primary care visit was less common (70% vs. 83%), as was having any visit to one's own (attributed) primary care provider (38% vs. 44%).|Public insurance was associated with less access to primary care and more PCS ED use; statewide labor shortages and low reimbursement rates from public insurance may have provided inadequate access to care that might otherwise have helped reduce PCS ED use.

Individuals with a colorectal cancer (CRC) detected within 36 months after a colonoscopy were identified and stratified on UC, Crohn's disease (CD) or non-IBD. The CRCs were classified as detected CRCs (dCRC) (0-6 months) or as PCCRCs (6-36 months). PCCRC rates were calculated by the number of false negative/(the number of true positive+the number of false negative) colonoscopies. Poisson regression analysis was employed to examine the association between PCCRC and IBD (CD and UC) diagnosis, age, gender, location, time period and comorbidities.|We identified 348 232 colonoscopies in 270 918 individuals. Of these, 27 123 were performed on 14 597 individuals with CD, and 51 572 were performed on 26 513 individuals with UC. There were 13 317 CRCs in the non-IBD group, 133 in the CD group and 281 in the UC group. The PCCRC rate in the CD group was 28.3% and 41.0% in the UC group. The RR for a PCCRC was 3.82 (95% CI 2.94 to 4.96) in CD and 5.89 (95% CI 5.10 to 6.80) in UC, compared with non-IBD. The highest risk was observed among rectal cancer location in CD and in younger individuals with UC.|The high rates of PCCRC in young patients with UC and for rectal cancer location in CD might affect future performance of IBD surveillance.

30591317	<TITLE>National production of certified reference fungal cultures.</TITLE>Reference fungal cultures (RFCs) are essential for the internal quality control of laboratories. The production of these cultures requires standardized procedures (IRAM 14950:2016 and ISO 17034:2016 standards) carried out by a recognized and accredited laboratory. The aim of this work was to produce RFC in paper disks of autochthonous strains, characterized by two, homogeneous and stable reference methods traceable at species level. RFC were produced using 14 regional species (7 yeasts and 7 filamentous fungi) from the fungal culture collection (DMic). Paper disks were impregnated with a culture suspension, dried and packed. Homogeneity, viability, identity and purity were verified. Short- and long-term stability at different temperatures and storage times were studied. Characterization of each strain allowed to confirm its identity and to ensure its traceability at international level. Produced batches were homogeneous and stable at -20±5°C for 30 months. This method of production was adequate to produce homogeneous and stable RFC with phenotypic and genotypic characteristics correctly defined and internationally traceable. Standardized procedures were developed for the production of certified RFC that could be transferred to other microorganisms. Providing RFC that represent regional strains allows laboratories to produce more reliable results with a favorable impact on medical diagnosis, the environment or the food industry.

30607146	<TITLE>Chemopreventive and biological activities of Helicteres isora L. fruit extracts.</TITLE>Helicteres isora L. (H. isora) has been used in traditional medicine in Asia. This study was aimed to determine biological activities of H. isora fruit extracts. Chemopreventive effect was examined by cell proliferation assay and differentiation-inducing effect. Anti-inflammatory activity of extracts was studied on the levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), and cyclooxygenas-2 (COX-2). Cell proliferation assay revealed that H. isora extracts and its major compound, rosmarinic acid, showed no cytotoxicity in THP-1 and RCM-1 cells. Methylthio acetic acid from Cucumis melo var.conomon used as a positive control and 80% ethanol extracts demonstrated significant cell differentiation induction. Hexane extract of H. isora could lower the levels of TNF-α, PGE-2, and NO in THP-1 cells with 51.61 ± 0.79%, 69.68 ± 0.017%, and 69.93 ± 9.41% inhibition, respectively. The highest inhibitory effect on COX-2 was obtained from dichloromethane extract. Dexamethasone inhibited the secretion of TNF-α with 95.82 ± 0.50% while celecoxib showed the inhibitory effect on COX-2 and PGE-2 with 100% and 99.86%, respectively. The ethanol extract showed the best antioxidant activity by DPPH and FRAP assays at IC50 of 5.43 ± 1.01 μg/mL and 22.83 ± 0.13 mmol FeSO4/g sample, respectively, while the positive control, trolox, showed the antioxidant activity with IC50 and FRAP values at 4.08 ± 0.85 μg/mL and 10.84 ± 0.04 mmol FeSO4/g sample, respectively. Taken together, H. isora possess chemopreventive and antioxidant activity. Further studies on in vivo activities of this plant are suggested.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30634904	<TITLE>Integration of proteomic and genomic approaches to dissect seed germination vigor in Brassica napus seeds differing in oil content.</TITLE>Rapeseed (Brassica napus, B. napus) is an important oil seed crop in the world. Previous studies showed that seed germination vigor might be correlated with seed oil content in B. napus, but the regulation mechanism for seed germination has not yet been explained clearly. Dissecting the regulation mechanism of seed germination and germination vigor is necessary.|Here, proteomic and genomic approaches were used to analyze the germination process in B. napus seeds with different oil content. The identification of 165 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the germinating seeds of B. napus with high and low oil content was accomplished by two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). The comparative proteomic results revealed that seeds with high oil content had higher metabolic activity, especially for sulfur amino acid metabolism. Thirty-one unique genes were shown to be significantly changed during germination between the seeds with high and low oil content, and thirteen of these genes were located within the confidence interval of germination-related quantitative trait locus (QTLs), which might play an important role in regulating seed germination vigor.|The present results are of importance for the understanding of the regulation mechanism for seed germination vigor in B. napus.

30647943	<TITLE>Treatment of Lower Limbs Telangiectasias with Nd: Yag Laser-Prospective Study on 446 Patients.</TITLE>In the last two decades Nd: YAG laser has become a standard of treatment of telangiectasias of the lower limbs in C1EAP stage of chronic venous insufficiency. This paper shows the results of a two years study period of telangiectasias of lower limbs with Nd: YAG laser conducted in a specialised centre in this type of procedures. The study group consisted of 446 patients (21 males and 425 females) with telangiectasias (C1EAP) on the lower limbs between January 2016-December 2017. The patients had to complete a form in which they noted the initial state on a scale from 1 to 10 but also the result of the treatment and the intensity of the pain during the laser treatment. Moreover, the doctor also evaluated the results of the treatment for each and every patient taking also into account the initial phase of the disease. We observed a significant improvement of the clinical appearance (the reduction of telangiectasias) almost in the entire study group, regardless of the gender and the age, but the intensity of the pain was higher in men and in persons under the age of 30. Based on these data we can conclude that Nd: YAG laser represents a minimally invasive therapeutic option with minor side effects and major aesthetic results and furthermore it can be combined with several other methods (microsclerotherapy, radiofrequency, complex surgery) in order to improve peripheral chronic venous insufficiency.

Consequently, the proportion of graphitic nitrogen (Ngraph) in the samples was systematically increased as a function of temperature. This allowed evaluation of the role of the CNx graphitic nitrogen in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A correlation between the Ngraph content and the ORR onset potential was observed, which shifted to more positive potentials with an increase in kinetic current density (jk); this showed that Ngraph played a significant catalytic role in the ORR. The samples with high Ngraph content favored the two-electron pathway for the ORR not only in basic media (pH = 13) but also in neutral media (pH = 7), representing an attractive alternative for wastewater remediation through the on-site generation of H2O2. The energetic calculations showed that the formation of H2O2 must be favorable in the presence of graphitic nitrogen sites. Finally, the performance of the buckypaper arrangement was evaluated, and the CNx buckypaper showed a higher cathodic current peak as compared to CNx traditional ink dispersions. Overall, this study not only sheds light on the role of Ngraph in the ORR, but also demonstrates that CNx buckypaper is an efficient 3D electrode for electrocatalytic applications.

This is the first miniature fluorescence LS-DAC system that has been fully packaged for handheld clinical use on patients. A novel micro-electro-mechanical system scanning mechanism, with synchronized tilting and pistoning, is used to achieve flat-field en face imaging. We show that this facilitates video mosaicking to generate images that sample an extended lateral field of view.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30817449	<TITLE>Combined impact of risk factors on the subsequent development of hypertension.</TITLE>This study aimed to develop a cumulative score composed of seven risk factors: age, resting heart rate, overweight or obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, impaired glucose regulation, and impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), to evaluate the risk of new-onset hypertension.|We retrospectively conducted a cohort study in 23 665 participants free from hypertension at baseline, who attended at least two annual health examinations between 2011 and 2016. We defined hypertension as SBP of 140 mmHg or less and/or DBP of at least 90 mmHg, according to the 2010 Chinese guidelines for the management of hypertension. We computed a composite, individual-level cumulative score incorporating all seven risk factors (no = 0 point; yes = 1 point; total range 0-7 points). Cox regression was used to analyze the association between cumulative score and risk of hypertension.|A total of 2305 participants developed hypertension during a median follow-up period of 3.6 years. Compared with participants with 0 points, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the development of hypertension for those with 2, 3, and at least 4 points were 1.61 (1.29-2.02), 2.05 (1.64-2.57) and 2.77 (2.22-3.46), respectively (P trend < 0.001). This association was present after adjustment for sex and baseline blood pressure.|Age, resting heart rate, overweight or obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, impaired glucose regulation, and impaired eGFR were associated with significant risk of new-onset hypertension and when combined there was an accumulation of risk.

Using Sonosite 180 plus, bladder volumes were calculated as, height × width × depth × proportionality constant (0.52, 0.625, 0.65, and 0.7) Patients were asked whether the patient heard or felt "bubbles" at the end of the investigation. Each patient was fluoroscopically screened and the clinician estimated the volume and compared with single-use catheter volume.|A total of 85 patients were assessed. All four formulae were significantly correlated. The PC, 0.52, correlated best (r = 0.938, P < 0.001) with no significant difference with the actual volumes ( P = 0.275). The "bubbles test" had a positive predictive value of 93%. A video postvoid residual (PVR) estimation significantly correlated with catheterised bladder volume ( r = 0.842, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the estimated and actual bladder volumes ( P = 0.579).|This study showed that although all four formulae correlated significantly, the PC of 0.52 was the only formula without a significant difference from the actual volume. More work is needed to produce patient individualised PC. Our clinicians were able to accurately estimate the PVR on X-ray. This study has identified the best formula to accurately estimate bladder volume and that video estimation along with the "bubbles" test can avoid unnecessary intervention.

Here, we review recent insights into the physiological and molecular responses of Populus to SS, including ion homeostasis and signaling pathways, such as the salt overly sensitive (SOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways. We summarize the genes that can be targeted for the genetic improvement of salt tolerance and propose future research areas.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
30939766	<TITLE>Evaluating the Safety Risk of Rural Roadsides Using a Bayesian Network Method.</TITLE>Evaluating the safety risk of rural roadsides is critical for achieving reasonable allocation of a limited budget and avoiding excessive installation of safety facilities. To assess the safety risk of rural roadsides when the crash data are unavailable or missing, this study proposed a Bayesian Network (BN) method that uses the experts' judgments on the conditional probability of different safety risk factors to evaluate the safety risk of rural roadsides. Eight factors were considered, including seven factors identified in the literature and a new factor named access point density. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study was conducted using 19.42 km long road networks in the rural area of Nantong, China. By comparing the results of the proposed method and run-off-road (ROR) crash data from 2015⁻2016 in the study area, the road segments with higher safety risk levels identified by the proposed method were found to be statistically significantly correlated with higher crash severity based on the crash data. In addition, by comparing the respective results evaluated by eight factors and seven factors (a new factor removed), we also found that access point density significantly contributed to the safety risk of rural roadsides. These results show that the proposed method can be considered as a low-cost solution to evaluating the safety risk of rural roadsides with relatively high accuracy, especially for areas with large rural road networks and incomplete ROR crash data due to budget limitation, human errors, negligence, or inconsistent crash recordings.

However, previous works have focused largely on Caucasian populations and less is known about Asian toddlers. We aimed to validate a semi-quantitative FFQ designed to assess dietary intakes of 18-month-old toddlers in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort.|An FFQ of ninety-four food items, identified based on food records of 12-month-old GUSTO children, the Southampton Women's Survey 12 Month Infancy Questionnaire and inputs from paediatric dietitians, was filled out two weeks before the 18th-month clinic visit. As the reference method, two non-consecutive 24 h recalls (24HR) were administered during and two weeks after the clinic visit. FFQ nutrient intakes were validated against averaged 24HR nutrient intakes, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman's rank-order correlation, cross-classification and the Bland-Altman method.|Data from the Singapore Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) mother-offspring birth cohort.ParticipantsToddlers (n 188) aged 18 months.|Absolute nutrient intakes from the FFQ were significantly higher than from the 24HR, except for vitamin A. After energy adjustments, r range was 0·56-0·78 (macronutrients) and 0·40-0·54 (micronutrients). De-attenuation increased r to 0·58-0·96 and 0·45-0·65 for macro- and micronutrients, respectively. Of participants, ≥82·4 % (macronutrients) and ≥77·7 % (micronutrients) were classified in the same and adjacent quartiles. No clear systematic increase in intake differences with increasing mean intake was observed in Bland-Altman plots.|This FFQ can provide a satisfactory assessment of toddlers' energy-adjusted nutrient intakes, as well as accurately rank them in a group.

31066619	<TITLE>Preparation and characterization of novel albumin-sericin nanoparticles as siRNA delivery vehicle for laryngeal cancer treatment.</TITLE>Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based gene silencing strategy has high potential on suppressing specific molecular targets, involved in cancer progression. However, the lack of an effective nanocarrier system that safely delivers siRNA to its target still limits the clinical applications of siRNA. This study aimed to develop albumin-sericin nanoparticles (Alb-Ser NPs) as a novel siRNA delivery system for laryngeal cancer treatment. Nanoparticle formulations composed of albumin and sericin at different ratios (1:1, 2:1, 1:2 w/w) were synthesized by desolvation method. The nanoparticles were modified with poly-L-lysine (PLL) for siRNA binding and decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA) to target laryngeal cancer cell line, Hep-2. HA/PLL/Alb-Ser NPs were individually loaded with siRNAs for casein kinase 2 (CK2), Absent, Small, or Homeotic-Like (ASH2L), and Cyclin D1 genes, which are overexpressed in Hep-2 cells. Downregulation of genes was confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Size, morphological, and thermogravimetric characterizations revealed that Alb-Ser NPs having 2:1 (w/w) ratio are the most optimized formulation. Between 36.8 and 61.3% of siRNA entrapment efficiencies were achieved. HA/PLL-siRNA/Alb-Ser (2:1) NPs-mediated gene silencing resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in cells. Our findings showed that HA/PLL/Alb-Ser (2:1) NPs were promising as a siRNA carrier.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31112888	<TITLE>Removal of E. coli and Salmonella in pot ceramic filters operating at different filtration rates.</TITLE>The use of pot ceramic filters PCF to improve the domestic water quality supply has been recognized as an alternative in regions where there is unsecure water treatment or contamination of the treated water during transport and storage and an absence of safe drinking water. The aim of this study was to evaluate a model of PCF impregnated with colloidal silver under three filtration rates (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 L/h) and three E. coli and Salmonella spp concentrations (104, 103 and 102 CFU/mL). The evaluation was made using spiked water having a turbidity of 29.9 ± 4.4 NTU and conductivity of 176 ± 31.7 μS/cm. The results showed a turbidity removal efficiency of 97% and average effluent of 0.9 NTU. The microbiological efficiency removal was of 2 Log Reduction Value (LRV) for E. coli and 1 LRV for Salmonella spp. There were not found significant statistical differences between the filtration rates and the removal efficiencies for turbidity E. coli and Salmonella spp. It was observed that the microbiological removal efficiency was affected by biofilm formation a phenomenon that was attributed to the presence of Salmonella spp. The combination of chemical and mechanical cleaning methods contributed to the elimination of the biofilm.

Specific, efficient, and safe protocols need to be developed.|To describe the technique of membrane-based TPE, the resulting physiological and metabolic changes, and to define an adequate regional citrate anticoagulation protocol.|Thirty-four dogs treated with TPE (2011-2017).|Retrospective review of all TPE treatments performed at the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, identified through a search of the institutional database for extracorporeal treatments.|Sixty-four treatments were performed, resulting in 1.0 plasma volume exchange (range, 0.4-1.1). Replacement fluids included fresh frozen plasma (12%-100% volume), colloids (0%-52%), human albumin (0%-41%), and saline (0%-70%). Anticoagulation was performed with regional citrate (n = 24), systemic heparinization (n = 2), or combined (n = 38). Main relevant laboratory changes included a 24.7% decrease in total proteins (interquartile range, 16.7-31.4; P < .001), 53% in fibrinogen (-30 to 63; P = .009), 36% in bilirubin (13-43, P = .02), 9.0% in urea (0.7-15.7; P < .001), and 4.5% in creatinine (-6.6 to 10.6; P = .006). Citrate accumulation was evidenced in all dogs, more pronounced in those with renal but not with hepatic impairment. Maximal tolerable citrate rates were estimated as 5.5 and 9.0 μmol/kg/min for treatments in dogs with and without renal impairment, respectively. Complications were observed in 22 treatments (34%) and were fatal in 2 dogs.|Therapeutic plasma exchange causes metabolic and biochemical alterations.

Overall, 235 patients with thalassemia major and 235 healthy controls were enrolled. Assessment of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in sera samples was performed using commercial ELISA kits. In order to the molecular investigate of T. gondii in blood samples, a relatively new molecular assay, LAMP technique based on Toxoplasma SAG1 gene was conducted for the first time. The specificity of LAMP outer primers for the T. gondii detection was confirmed by sequencing the purified PCR product.|51.9% of thalassemia patients and 34.8% of healthy controls were positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, which the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). In terms of anti-Toxoplasma IgM antibody, 3.4% of thalassemia patients and 2.1% of healthy individuals were positive, which the difference was not statistically significant (P=1). Based on SAG1-LAMP, 9.78% of the thalassemia patients and 5.95% of healthy controls were positive for T. gondii DNA, which the difference was not statistically significant (P≤0.230).|Thalassemia patients, probably due to repeated blood transfusion and consequently, immune deficiency, are at risk of transmitting Toxoplasma infection more than healthy people. Therefore, screening of Toxoplasma infection in blood transfusion centers may be effective in the prevention of toxoplasmosis in these patients.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31175548	<TITLE>A Novel Unification Method to Characterize a Broad Class of Growth Curve Models Using Relative Growth Rate.</TITLE>Growth curve models serve as the mathematical framework for the quantitative studies of growth in many areas of applied science. The evolution of novel growth curves can be categorized in two notable directions, namely generalization and unification. In case of generalization, a modeler starts with a simple mathematical form to describe the behavior of the data and increases the complexity of the equation by incorporating more parameters to obtain a more flexible shape. The unification refers to the process of obtaining a compact representation of a large number of growth equations. An enormous number of growth equations are made available in the literature by means of the generalization of existing growth laws. However, the unification of growth equations has received relatively less attention from the researchers. Two significant unification functions are available in the literature, namely the Box-Cox transformation by Garcia (For Biometry Model Inf Sci 1:63-68, 2005) and generalized logarithmic and exponential functions by Martinez et al. (Phys A 387:5679-5687, 2008; Phys A 388:2922-2930, 2009). Existing unification approaches are found to have limited applications if the growth equation is characterized by the relative growth rate (RGR). RGR has immense practical value in biological growth curve analysis, which has been amplified by the construction of size and time covariate models, in which; RGR is represented either as a function of size or time or both. The present study offers a unification function for the RGR growth curves. The proposed function combines a broad class of the growth curves and possesses a greater generality than the existing unification functions. We also propose the notion of generalized RGR, which is capable of making interrelations among the unifying functions. Our proposed method is expected to enhance the generality of software and may aid in choosing an optimal model from a set of competitor growth equations.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31180880	<TITLE>Finding Influential Nodes in Multiplex Networks Using a Memetic Algorithm.</TITLE>In order to find the nodes with better propagation ability, a large body of studies on the influence maximization problem has been conducted. Several influence spreading models and corresponding optimization algorithms have been proposed and successfully identified the infusive seeds in single isolated networks. However, as indicated by some recent studies and online materials, modern networked systems tend to have more complicated structures and multiple layers, which makes it difficult for existing seed determination techniques to deal with these networks. Thus, finding influential nodes in realistic multiplex networks remains open. Therefore, this paper aims to design an extended influence spreading model to simulate the influence diffusion process in multiplex networks, based on which a memetic algorithm is developed to find the seeds that are influential in all network layers. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. These results are helpful for identifying potential propagators in multiplex social networks, and provide solutions to analyze and gain deeper insights into networked systems.

A list of texture features was generated for lesion classification. Fisher's discriminant analysis (FDA) was used to construct a predictive model from these parameters and to estimate the discriminant accuracy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance of texture analysis of benign and malignant tumours.|Fifteen texture features were significant differences between the five different histopathological types of all lesions. The total discriminant accuracy was 69.3%, with 55.7% cross-validation accuracy. Seven texture features showed significant differences between the benign and malignant tumours. The total discriminant accuracy in the sample was 83%, with 77.3% cross-validation accuracy. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of united texture features was 0.927 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.875-0.979).|CTTA can be used as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hypervascular solid focal hepatic lesions, especially the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions.

31220249	<TITLE>Screening methods for detection of ancient Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex fingerprints in next-generation sequencing data derived from skeletal samples.</TITLE>Recent advances in ancient DNA studies, especially in increasing isolated DNA yields and quality, have opened the possibility of analysis of ancient host microbiome. However, such pitfalls as spurious identification of pathogens based on fragmentary data or environmental contamination could lead to incorrect epidaemiological conclusions. Within the Mycobacterium genus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members responsible for tuberculosis share up to ∼99% genomic sequence identity, while other more distantly related Mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis can be causative agents for pulmonary diseases or soil dwellers. Therefore, reliable determination of species complex is crucial for interpretation of sequencing results.|Here we present a novel bioinformatical approach, used for screening of ancient tuberculosis in sequencing data, derived from 28 individuals (dated 4400-4000 and 3100-2900 BC) from central Poland. We demonstrate that cost-effective next-generation screening sequencing data (∼20M reads per sample) could yield enough information to provide statistically supported identification of probable ancient disease cases.|Application of appropriate bioinformatic tools, including an unbiased selection of genomic alignment targets for species specificity, makes it possible to extract valid data from full-sample sequencing results (without subjective targeted enrichment procedures). This approach broadens the potential scope of palaeoepidaemiology both to older, suboptimally preserved samples and to pathogens with difficult intrageneric taxonomy.

31337810	<TITLE>Neurodevelopment and asymmetry of auditory-related responses to repetitive syllabic stimuli in preterm neonates based on frequency-domain analysis.</TITLE>Sensory development of the human brain begins prenatally, allowing cortical auditory responses to be recorded at an early age in preterm infants. Despite several studies focusing on the temporal characteristics of preterm infants' cortical responses, few have been conducted on frequency analysis of these responses. In this study, we performed frequency and coherence analysis of preterm infants' auditory responses to series of syllables and also investigated the functional brain asymmetry of preterm infants for the detection of the regularity of auditory stimuli. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded in 16 preterm infants with a mean recording age of 31.48 weeks gestational age (29.57-34.14 wGA) in response to a repetitive syllabic stimulus. Peak amplitudes of the frequency response at the target frequency and the first harmonic, as well as the phase coherence (PC) at the target frequency were extracted as age-dependent variables. A functional asymmetry coefficient was defined as a lateralization index for the amplitude of the target frequency at each electrode site. While the findings revealed a significant positive correlation between the mean amplitude at the target frequency vs. age (R2 = 0.263, p = 0.042), no significant correlation was observed for age-related changes of the mean amplitude at the first harmonic. A significant correlation was also observed between the mean PC and age (R2 = 0.318, p = 0.023). A right hemisphere lateralization over many channels was also generally observed. The results demonstrate that rightward lateralization for slow rate modulation, previously observed in adults, children and newborns, appears to be in place at a very young age, even in preterm infants.

31455187	<TITLE>The evolutionary dynamics of the early Palaeozoic marine biodiversity accumulation.</TITLE>The early Palaeozoic Era records the initial biodiversification of the Phanerozoic. The increase in biodiversity involved drastic changes in taxon longevity, and in rates of origination and extinction. Here, we calculate these variables in unprecedented temporal resolution. We find that highly volatile origination and extinction rates are associated with short genus longevities during the Cambrian Period. During the Ordovician and Silurian periods, evolutionary rates were less volatile and genera persisted for increasingly longer intervals. The 90%-genus life expectancy doubled from 5 Myr in the late Cambrian to more than 10 Myr in the Ordovician-Silurian periods. Intervals with widespread ecosystem disruption are associated with short genus longevities during the Cambrian and with exceptionally high longevities during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. The post-Cambrian increase in persistence of genera, therefore, indicates an elevated ability of the changing early Palaeozoic marine ecosystems to sustainably maintain existing genera. This is evidence of a new level of ecosystem resilience which evolved during the Ordovician Period.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

In addition to socio-demographics, validated measures including COPD knowledge questionnaire, the 4-item self-reported Morisky medication adherence scale, St George respiratory questionnaire and Health Anxiety and Depression scale were used in the present study. The stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify variables that independently and significantly predicted medication non-adherence.|Predictors of medication non-adherence.|A total of 133 patients participated in the study. Results indicated that majority of the patients (61.7%) were non-adherent. According to the model, patients were four times more likely to be non-adherent if they reported having depression (OR 0.251, CI 0.24-0.76) and approximately eight times to have medication non-adherence if they suffered from comorbid illness (OR 0.119, CI 0.11-0.80). Study participants were found to have a double risk of medication nonadherence if they received an increase in the frequency of administration of their COPD medication (OR 0.524, CI 0.08-0.69) and being concerned about side effects (OR 0.515, CI 0.36-0.92).|Depression, dosage regimen complexity, the presence of co-morbidities and therapy side effects have significantly influenced adherence to COPD therapy in the present study.

31493637	<TITLE>Emotional support from social media and face-to-face relationships: Associations with depression risk among young adults.</TITLE>Emotional support is highly protective against poor mental health. Though several measures of emotional support exist, none specifically addresses social media (SM) as a source of emotional support. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine if SM-based emotional support is an extension of or distinct construct from face-to-face (FTF) emotional support and to assess the independent associations between each domain of emotional support and depression risk among U.S. young adults.|In March 2018, we surveyed 2408 18-30 year olds. We assessed perceived FTF emotional support with the brief PROMIS emotional support scale and perceived SM-based emotional support using a new four-item measure. Depression risk was assessed using the PHQ-9. We performed factor analysis (FA) to determine the underlying factor structure of all items and to develop composite scales. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the independent association between each resulting emotional support scale and depression risk.|FA revealed two distinct constructs. FTF emotional support was associated with 43% lower odds of depression per 1-unit increase on the 5-point scale (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.52-0.63). However, SM-based emotional support was significantly associated with 20% greater odds of depression per 1-unit increase on the 5-point scale (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09-1.32).|This study utilized a cross-sectional design and self-report data.|While FTF emotional support was associated with slightly lower odds of depression, SM-based emotional support was associated with slightly greater odds of depression. It may be valuable for clinicians treating individuals with depression to ask about sources of emotional support.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31564232	<TITLE>Silencing lncRNA HOTAIR declines synovial inflammation and synoviocyte proliferation and promotes synoviocyte apoptosis in osteoarthritis rats by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</TITLE>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative injury of the articular cartilage and reactive hyperplasia of the articular rim and subchondral bone. Due to its poor prognosis, this study is to research the influences of lncRNA HOTAIR on synovial inflammation and synoviocyte apoptosis and proliferation in OA rats by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Rat OA model was constructed by means of cruciate ligament resection, and the successfully modeled rats were injected with sh-HOTAIR, or Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator (LiCl), and synoviocytes were transfected with sh-HOTAIR or LiCl for investigation of the influences of HOTAIR and Wnt/β-catenin pathway on synoviocytes proliferation and apoptosis. ELISA and RT-qPCR were used to detect the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum, synovial tissue and synoviocytes in rats, respectively. The protein levels of bax, bcl-2, wnt1 and β-catenin in synovial tissue and synoviocytes were tested by Western blot analysis. Highly expressed HOTAIR existed in synovial tissue and synoviocytes of rats. There were declining arthritis index, inflammation, synoviocytes proliferation, cycle progression and promoted synoviocytes apoptosis by silencing HOTAIR and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Down-regulation of HOTAIR could reverse the effect of LiCl on progression of OA rats. There was strained activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway via declining HOTAIR. This study suggests that silencing lncRNA HOTAIR and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway decline synovial inflammation and synoviocyte proliferation and promote apoptosis in OA rats.

It is a common cause of oral ulcers in children. In its major form, RAS can be a severe and disabling disorder due to pain and scarring, and poses a therapeutic challenge. Therapies for major RAS include prednisone, thalidomide, colchicine, and dapsone. However, many patients do not achieve adequate control of the disease with them (J Clin Diagn Res, 10, 2016 and ZE08). We report a case of severe RAS in a teenager with a dramatic response to adalimumab.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

This was a cross-sectional study which recruited 209 patients with T2DM. Urinary megalin was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r=0.218, p=0.04) but negatively with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (r=-0.16, p=0.023). The levels of urinary albumin, triglycerides (TGs) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were higher in the "high-megalin" group, compared to those in "low-megalin" group. Moreover, there was a significant inverse association between vitamin D3 levels and megalin levels in urine (OR=0.281, p=0.047).|Our study showed for the first time that megalin is associated with progression factors of diabetic nephropathy as well as vitamin D deficiency (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 15).

31616016	<TITLE>Metabarcoding assessment of prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa in sediments from Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.</TITLE>Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) in the Gulf of Maine is a historic fishing ground renowned for remarkable productivity. Biodiversity conservation is a key management priority for SBNMS and yet data on the diversity of microorganisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, is lacking. This study utilized next generation sequencing to characterize sedimentary communities within SBNMS at three sites over two seasons. Targeting 16S and 18S small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences, samples contained high diversity at all taxonomic levels and identified 127 phyla, including 115 not previously represented in the SBNMS Management Plan and Environmental Assessment. A majority of the diversity was bacterial, with 59 phyla, but also represented were nine Archaea, 18 Animalia, 14 Chromista, eight Protozoa, two Plantae, and 17 Fungi phyla. Samples from different sites and seasons were dominated by the same high abundance organisms but displayed considerable variation in rare taxa. The levels of biodiversity seen on this small spatial scale suggest that benthic communities of this area support a diverse array of micro- and macro-organisms, and provide a baseline for future studies to assess changes in community structure in response to rapid warming in the Gulf of Maine.

31616240	<TITLE>Acupuncture Improves Comorbid Cognitive Impairments Induced by Neuropathic Pain in Mice.</TITLE>Growing evidence indicates that neuropathic pain is frequently accompanied by cognitive impairments, which aggravate the quality of life of chronic pain patients. Here, we investigated whether acupuncture treatments can improve cognitive dysfunction as well as allodynia induced by neuropathic pain in mice. One week after the left partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL), acupuncture treatments on the acupoints GB30-GB34 (AP1), HT7-GV20 (AP2), or control points (CP) were performed for 4 weeks. Notably, the significant attenuations of mechanical allodynia and cognitive impairment were observed in the AP1 group, but not in PSNL, AP2, or CP groups. A random decision forest classifier based on the pain and cognitive functions displayed that the acupuncture group was clearly segregated from the other groups. We also demonstrated that acupuncture restored the reduced field excitatory post-synaptic potentials and was able to elevate the expression levels of glutamate receptors (NR2B and GluR1) in the hippocampus. Moreover, the expressions of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and synaptic proteins (pPSD-95 and pSyn-1) were enhanced by acupuncture treatment. These results suggest that acupuncture can enhance hippocampal long-term action through the regulation of the synaptic efficacy and that acupuncture may provide a viable option for managing both pain and cognitive functions associated with chronic neuropathic pain.

Sievers classification was type 0 in 2 patients and type 1 in 7 patients. The simulations altered the treatment strategy in 8 patients (89%). The simulations suggested moderate to severe paravalvular regurgitation in 3 patients, who were referred for consideration of surgery. The remaining 6 patients underwent TAVR with a self-expanding THV. In 5 of these patients (83%), THV size and/or implantation depth was altered to minimize paravalvular regurgitation and/or conduction disturbance. In 1 patient, simulations suggested significant conduction disturbance after TAVR, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted before the procedure. Following treatment, all 9 patients had no to mild paravalvular regurgitation. The patient who had a pre-procedure permanent pacemaker implanted became pacing dependent, with underlying third-degree atrioventricular block.|Patient-specific computer simulation of TAVR in BAV can be used to identify those patients where TAVR may be associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Patient-specific computer simulation may be useful to guide THV sizing and positioning for potential favorable clinical outcomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31642496	<TITLE>Gene4Denovo: an integrated database and analytic platform for de novo mutations in humans.</TITLE>De novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES/WGS from 23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo (http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/), which allowed these genetic data to be conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed. In addition, Gene4Denovo integrated data from >60 genomic sources to provide comprehensive variant-level and gene-level annotation and information regarding the DNMs and candidate genes. Furthermore, Gene4Denovo provides end-users with limited bioinformatics skills to analyse their own genetic data, perform comprehensive annotation, and prioritize candidate genes using custom parameters. In conclusion, Gene4Denovo conveniently allows for the accelerated interpretation of DNM pathogenicity and the clinical implication of DNMs in humans.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31674497	<TITLE>Analytical microring stereo system using coupled mode theory and application.</TITLE>A stereo resonating system, including two cascaded Panda resonators with two small rings is proposed as a microscale active stereo system. The optical transfer functions of the Panda stereo system for two input ports and one output port are derived using the coupled mode theory. The feasibility of the Panda stereo system to realize three-dimensional content is investigated by applying different coupling coefficients and materials to each Panda resonator. The effect of the coupling strength of the ${3} \times {3}$3×3 coupler on the output light is also studied. It is interesting that a portion of input light into the Panda stereo system can undergo a wavelength shift and an intensity shift by adjusting the coupling coefficients of the ${3} \times {3}$3×3 coupler together with fine-tuning the refractive index of one of the Panda resonators. Results show that a change of the ${3} \times {3}$3×3 coupler brings about a shift from 0.1 to 37 dB in light transmission and applying a change of $\delta n = 0.01$δn=0.01 in the refractive index of one of the Panda resonators generated a phase shift larger than $\pi /{4}$π/4, which is required for image depth reconstruction. The advantages of the proposed Panda stereo system compared to the conventional stereo technology are low cost and a microsize, with a simple structure and the ability to work in a different wavelength spectrum range.

31679505	<TITLE>Role of mitochondrial DNA in oxidative damage induced by sodium arsenite in human bronchial epithelial cells.</TITLE>Long-term exposure to sodium arsenite was found to induce malignant transformation in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line as evidenced by elevated ROS levels. Although chronic sodium arsenite-induced HBE cell line transformation was associated with elevated ROS generation, it was of interest to determine whether acute sodium arsenite exposure also initiated pulmonary damage. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate oxidative-stress-related pulmonary damage using a human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line. Incubation of ρ+-HBE (in the presence of mitochondrial DNA) cells with various concentrations of sodium arsenite, significantly increased ROS and MDA levels accompanied by decreased SOD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, treatment of ρ-HBE (without mitochondrial DNA) cells various concentrations of sodium arsenite a reduction in ROS and MDA levels were noted. However, the SOD activity remained decreased in ρ-HBE cells. This was accompanied by a significant rise in HO-1 protein expressions levels in both cell types with greater changes ρ-HBE cells at the lower sodium arsenite concentrations. Data indicate that acute sodium arsenite exposure exerted a greater effect ρ-HBE cells suggesting that absence of mitochondrial DNA appears to enhance sensitivity to the oxidant actions of inorganic As.

31692564	<TITLE>Immediate Manifestation of Ocular Decompression Retinopathy following Anterior Chamber Paracentesis.</TITLE>Ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) is a complication of rapid lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting in hemorrhages in multiple retinal layers. We report a case of ODR that developed within minutes following anterior chamber paracentesis in an adult female with primary open-angle glaucoma. A 61-year-old Black woman with primary open-angle glaucoma presented with marked elevation of IOP (46 mm Hg in the right eye and 30 mm Hg in the left) despite maximal medical therapy and bilateral selective laser trabeculoplasty. Vision in the right eye decreased from counting fingers at 3 feet 1 week earlier to no light perception at the time of presentation. Anterior chamber paracentesis was performed on the right eye to reduce IOP and stabilize the eye until further surgical intervention could be performed. IOP in the right eye decreased to 6 mm Hg postoperatively. Within minutes of the procedure, several intraretinal blot hemorrhages appeared in the periphery of the right eye. During this time, visual acuity remained at no light perception. The findings were consistent with decompression retinopathy. By 12 weeks postoperatively, the ODR had resolved with visual acuity of light perception and normal fundoscopy except for profound cupping. Our case demonstrates how rapidly ocular decompression can form following IOP reduction.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

In the CII protocol group (n=91), multivariable binary logistic regression analysis models were used to determine the independent associates with a delayed response (taking ≥6.0 hours for entering a glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL). The CII protocol was adjusted in silico according to the EHR-based parameters obtained in the first 3 hours of CII.|Use of the CII protocol was associated with fewer subjects with hypoglycemia alert values (P=0.003), earlier (P=0.002), and more stable (P=0.017) achievement of a glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL. Initial glucose level (P=0.001), change in glucose during the first 2 hours (P=0.026), and change in insulin infusion rate during the first 3 hours (P=0.029) were independently associated with delayed responses. Increasing the insulin infusion rate temporarily according to these parameters in silico significantly reduced delayed responses (P<0.0001) without hypoglycemia, especially in refractory patients.|Our CII protocol enabled faster and more stable glycemic control than conventional care with minimized risk of hypoglycemia. An EHR-based adjustment was simulated to reduce delayed responses without increased incidence of hypoglycemia.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

This report updates previous summaries of progress on these goals by U.S. states and territories. Data are based on the Hearing Screening and Follow-up Survey (HSFS) conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the years 2006-2016. Trends were assessed using 3-year moving averages, with rates of newborns lost to follow-up or lost to documentation (LTF/D) also examined. During this period, the percentage of infants screened before one month increased from 85.1% to 95.3%, while the percentage receiving diagnostic testing before three months increased from 19.8% to 36.6%, and the percentage of infants identified with permanent hearing loss enrolled in early intervention (EI) before six months increased from 25.1% to 47.2%. Percentages of infants who ultimately received screening, diagnostic testing, and early intervention services - regardless of timing - were higher. During this period, LTF/D declined from 42.1% to 31.3% for diagnostic testing, and 39.4% to 20.3% for EI services. Diagnoses of hearing loss recorded increased from 0.9 to 1.7 per 1,000 infants screened, likely reflecting improved data.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31772975	<TITLE>Clinical Commissioning of a Pencil Beam Scanning Treatment Planning System for Proton Therapy.</TITLE>In this report, we present the commissioning and validation results for a commercial proton pencil beam scanning RayStation treatment planning system.|The commissioning data requirements are (1) integrated depth dose curves, (2) spot profiles, (3) absolute dose/monitor unit calibration, and (4) virtual source position. An 8-cm parallel plate chamber was used to measure the integrated depth dose curves by scanning a beam composed of a single spot in a water phantom. The spot profiles were measured at 5 different planes using a 2-dimensional scintillation detector. The absolute dose/monitor unit calibration was based on dose measurements in single-layer fields of size 10 × 10 cm2. The virtual-source position was calculated from the change in spot spacing with the distance from the isocenter. The beam model validation consisted of a comparison against commissioning data as well as a new set of verification measurements. For end-to-end testing, a series of phantom plans were created. These plans were measured at 1 to 3 depths using a 2-dimensional ion chamber array and evaluated for gamma index using the 3% and 3 mm criteria.|The maximum deviation for spot sigma measured versus calculated was -0.2 mm. The point-dose measurements for single-layer beams were within ± 3%, except for the largest field size (29 × 29 cm2) and the highest energy (226 MeV). The point doses in the spread-out Bragg peak plans showed a trend in which differences > 3% were seen for ranges > 30 cm, field sizes > 15 × 15 cm2, and depths > 25 cm. For end-to-end testing, 34 planes corresponding to 13 beams were analyzed for gamma index with a minimum pass rate of 92.8%.|The acceptable verification results and successful end-to-end testing ensured that all components of the treatment planning system were functional and the system was ready for clinical use.

31777551	<TITLE>M2 tumor-associated macrophages promote tumor progression in non-small-cell lung cancer.</TITLE>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment that can be polarized into different phenotypes, including tumor-inhibiting M1 macrophages and tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. To elucidate the biological and clinical significance of M2 TAMs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a comprehensive clinical assessment of the tissue distribution of M2 TAMs was performed. The tissue distribution of M2 TAMs was retrospectively analyzed using CD163 immunohistochemistry in 160 consecutive patients who underwent NSCLC resection. Tumor proliferation was evaluated via the Ki-67 proliferation index. The results revealed that the stromal density of M2 TAMs was significantly associated with the C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P=0.0250), the Ki-67 proliferation index (P=0.0090) and invasive size (P=0.0285). Furthermore, the stromal M2 TAM density was significantly associated with tumor differentiation (P=0.0018), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0347) and pathological stage (P=0.0412). The alveolar M2 TAM density was also significantly associated with the CRP level (P=0.0309), invasive size (P<0.0001), tumor differentiation (P=0.0192), tumor status (P=0.0108) and pathological stage (P=0.0110). By contrast, no association was observed between islet M2 TAM density and the aforementioned biological and clinical factors. In regards to prognosis, disease-free survival rate was significantly lower in patients with stromal M2 TAM-high tumors (P=0.0270) and in those with alveolar M2 TAM-high tumors (P=0.0283). Furthermore, the overall survival rate was also significantly lower in patients with stromal M2 TAM-high tumors (P=0.0162) and in those with alveolar M2 TAM-high tumors (P=0.0225). Therefore, during NSCLC progression, M2 TAMs may induce tumor cell aggressiveness and proliferation and increase metastatic potential, resulting in a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.

In this study, Neuro-2a cells were exposed to β-HgS, MeHgCl and HgCl2 (5 µM) for 6-24 h. The cell viability of β-HgS was higher than MeHgCl with 25.9% and 72.4% in 12 h and 24 h respectively. As the incubation time increased, MeHgCl had obvious damage to cell morphology, decreased the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bak and increased the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β significantly. Furthermore, the expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 in HgCl2 group were increased significantly in 6 h and 24 h. The apoptotic rates in MeHgCl and HgCl2 group were respectively higher than β-HgS with 32.2% and 7.30% in 24 h. Our findings indicate that β-HgS is much less neurotoxicity than MeHgCl and HgCl2 in Neuro-2a cells.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31794239	<TITLE>The Effects of Training to Reduce Automatic Action Tendencies Toward Alcohol Using the Virtual Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task in Heavy Social Drinkers.</TITLE>This study aimed to reduce the approach tendency toward alcohol among heavy social drinkers using the Virtual Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Training Task training. A total of 28 heavy social drinkers were randomly assigned to either the training group (n = 14) or the control group (n = 14). The training group was implicitly trained to avoid situations that involved drinking alcohol and to approach situations that involved drinking nonalcoholic beverages. On the other hand, the control group received a sham training condition with the same ratio of approach or avoidance of drinking either alcohol or a nonalcoholic beverage. All participants made three visits in a period of 2-3 weeks to participate in either the training or sham training. As a result, the training group showed a decrease in implicit approach tendencies toward alcohol, but not in explicit craving for alcohol. In contrast, the control group showed an increase in both implicit approach tendencies and explicit craving toward alcohol. These results indicate that the virtual reality training to avoid alcohol-related stimuli or environments might reduce automatic action tendencies toward alcohol, while simply being exposed to alcohol-related stimuli or environments might increase craving for alcohol in the sham training group. Our findings also suggest that, including not only visual stimuli but also auditory stimuli in a virtual environment might be a tool for changing approach bias.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31870984	<TITLE>Sensing Matrix Design for Compressive Spectral Imaging via Binary Principal Component Analysis.</TITLE>Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) is a framework that captures coded-and-multiplexed low-dimensional projections of spectral data-cubes. In general, the sensing process in many CSI architectures is described using binary matrices, so-called sensing/projection matrices, whose elements can be either random or designed. However, some characteristics of the spectral data, such as the ℓ2-norm or the second moment statistics, can be lost when this dimensionality reduction is performed. Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) is a data dimensionality reduction technique that minimizes the least-squared error between the spectral data and its low-dimensional projection, but preserving its structure or variance. Thus, PCA can be used to guide the CSI acquisition process by designing the binary sensing matrix. Nonetheless, PCA requires to know the spectral image a-priori, and also, its associated projection matrix is not binary, as required by CSI optical architectures. Therefore, in this paper, an algorithm to design CSI sensing matrices by exploiting the structure-preserving property of the PCA projection is proposed. First, a set of compressive measurements obtained with random sensing matrices is used to rapidly estimate the covariance matrix associated with the spectral data. Then, a new sensing matrix is designed by solving a non-convex optimization problem that finds a set of binary vectors that approximate the principal components of the covariance matrix, thus maximizing the explanation of the data variance. Experimental results show an improvement of up to 3 dB in image reconstruction quality, in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), when the binary PCA-based sensing matrices are used and compared with conventional random sensing matrices and state-of-art designed matrices based on PCA.

31900726	<TITLE>Epidural catheters are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in trauma.</TITLE>Little is known about the association between epidural catheters (EC) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in trauma. We sought to study this association and hypothesized that trauma patients with EC were more likely to develop VTE. Using the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS) registry, we identified all adult trauma patients (age ≥ 18) admitted for at least 2 days between 1/2013 and 12/2017. Baseline characteristics and outcome variables were compared between patients who underwent EC placement and those who did not. The primary outcome was development of VTE. 147,721 patients met inclusion criteria; 2247 (1.5%) developed a VTE. Patients were mostly white (85%), male (56%), with blunt trauma (94%). 776 (0.5%) had an EC placed. Patients who underwent EC placement were more likely to develop a VTE (2.8% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.003). After adjusting for covariates, patients with EC were 1.6 times more likely to develop VTE (95% CI 1.1-2.5). The overall rate of VTE was low and associated with the use of EC. Future work should focus on determining the underlying mechanisms.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
31933234	<TITLE>Ultrasound risk stratification systems for thyroid nodule: between lights and shadows, we are moving towards a new era.</TITLE>Ultrasound (US) has long played a major role in the assessment of thyroid nodules and their risk of malignancy, and its importance has been further enhanced over the past decade by the development of a number of US-based risk stratification systems (US-RSSs), referred to in some cases as TIRADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting And Data Systems). The high-risk categories of all currently available US-RSSs display strong associations to cytological diagnostic classes of "malignant/suspicious-for-malignancy" and the low-risk classes are clearly associated to "not neoplastic/benign" cytology. The introduction of these systems has elevated the diagnostic performance of US to a level approaching that of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. The time seems ripe to exploit this new level of accuracy to reduce the number of FNAs for nodules likely to be benign (i.e., sonographically classified as low-risk with no suspicious clinical features). In the near future, US-RSS could also become the main tool for diagnosing papillary thyroid cancers. The establishment of a new "international TIRADS"-currently in progress-will be critical to guide us towards a new era.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The presence of distal caries of M2Ms, patient age and gender, impaction depths and mesial angulation of M3Ms, the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) distances and contact point localization, and the horizontal positions of M3Ms were assessed. Risk factors were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.|The overall prevalence of distal caries in M2Ms was 31.6%. Mesial angulation (16°-75°) of M3Ms, contact point localization at or below the CEJ of M2Ms, and a buccal or lingual position of M3Ms relative to the molar line were identified as risk factors for the prevalence of distal caries in M2Ms (p < 0.05). Distal caries was more severe when the mesial angulation of M3Ms was 16°-75° (p < 0.05).|Buccal or lingual position of M3Ms may represent a new risk factor for the distal caries in M2Ms. Mesial angulation (16°-75°) of M3Ms is a predictive parameter for both the presence and severity of distal caries in M2Ms.|As the presence of distal caries in M2Ms is significantly associated with the three-dimensional position of M3Ms, watchful monitoring or prophylactic removal of M3Ms should be deliberated when M3Ms are mesially angulated (16°-75°), buccally or lingually positioned, and with the contact point localization at or below the CEJ of M2Ms.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
32032655	<TITLE>Interlink between improved formulations, inhibitory concentrations and cell death mechanism investigations of cytotoxic drugs: What really matters?</TITLE>In this article, IC50 concentrations derived from MTT assay for further evaluating of cell death induced by new formulations were discussed. This review attempts to introduce an enhanced approach for evaluation of cell death mechanisms based on routine cytotoxicity assays for anti-cancer medications. It is highly desirable for anti-cancer drugs to induce apoptotic cell death in order to have better efficacy and less complications. According to our previous results and other comparable studies, cell death mechanisms and phenotypes followed by cytotoxic drugs are rigorously concentration dependent; therefore, calculated IC50s obtained through cytotoxicity assays should be exactly employed for evaluating of cell death mechanisms. More appropriately, it is better to select concentrations which are closer to the efficient plasma levels for additional cell death evaluations. If enough amounts of new formulated materials are available, it is suggested to calculate and compare IC50s for old and improved formulations at different concentration ranges; otherwise, when materials are not sufficiently available or the toxicity of new formulation is not high enough to yield an IC50, then some specific point to point comparison between corresponding concentrations within a reasonable range should be made. Another important point is that IC50 values obtained via in vitro assays are frequently higher than in vivo or therapeutic plasma concentrations and it seems better to use improved formulation's IC50s which are more comparable to clinical plasma concentrations or consider IC25s of free drugs for determination of cell death mechanisms.

Information on health outcomes of children including birth parameters, demographic characteristics, medical and child-rearing history, and nutritional status, were repeatedly obtained through the follow-ups by questionnaires administration, clinical evaluation, and biological specimen collection and measurements. Prenatal and postnatal measurement in biospecimen, i.e., lead, mercury, cadmium, manganese, 1-hydroxypyrene, 2-naphthol, malonadialdehyde, hippuric acid, bisphenol A and phthalate metabolites, and measurement in air samples, i.e., particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds were performed.|The results show the adverse effect of prenatal exposure to heavy metals like mercury, lead and cadmium on children's physical, cognitive and neurobehavioral development. Exposure to endocrine disruptors, air pollution, second hand smoke, and mother's lifestyle during pregnancy affects children's growth and development. We also identified specific window periods of exposure of pollutants significantly related to children's health outcomes.|The collective results from MOCEH study provide strong scientific evidence that exposures to prenatal and postnatal environmental pollutants have a negative effect on growth and development of children, which will be useful in implementing effective national policy to improve children's environmental health.

32121909	<TITLE>Geometric calibration for LiDAR-camera system fusing 3D-2D and 3D-3D point correspondences.</TITLE>Calibrating the extrinsic parameters on a system of 3D Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and the monocular camera is a challenging task, because accurate 3D-2D or 3D-3D point correspondences are hard to establish from the sparse LiDAR point clouds in the calibration procedure. In this paper, we propose a geometric calibration method for estimating the extrinsic parameters of the LiDAR-camera system. In this method, a novel combination of planar boards with chessboard patterns and auxiliary calibration objects are proposed. The planar chessboard provides 3D-2D and 3D-3D point correspondences. Auxiliary calibration objects provide extra constraints for stable calibration results. After that, a novel geometric optimization framework is proposed to utilize these point correspondences, thus leading calibration results robust to LiDAR sensor noise. Besides, we contribute an automatic approach to extract point clouds of calibration objects. In the experiments, our method has a superior performance over state-of-the-art calibration methods. Furthermore, we verify our method by computing depth map and improvements can also be found. These results demonstrate that our method performance on the LiDAR-camera system is applicable for future advanced visual applications.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
32165435	<TITLE>Phenotypic flexibility of metabolic rate and evaporative water loss does not vary across a climatic gradient in an Afrotropical passerine bird.</TITLE>Small birds inhabiting northern temperate and boreal latitudes typically increase metabolic rates during cold winters or acclimation to low air temperatures (Taccl). Recent studies suggest considerable variation in patterns of seasonal metabolic acclimatization in birds from subtropical and tropical regions with milder winters, but there remains a dearth of acclimation studies investigating metabolic flexibility among lower-latitude birds. We used short-term thermal acclimation experiments to investigate phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermoneutral evaporative water loss (EWL) and summit metabolism (Msum) in three populations of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser mahali) along a climatic and aridity gradient. We allocated individuals to one of three Taccl treatments (5, 20 and 35°C; n=11 per population per Taccl) for 28 days, and measured post-acclimation BMR, EWL and Msum using flow-through respirometry. Our data reveal the expected pattern of lower BMR and EWL (∼12% and 25% lower, respectively) in birds at Taccl=35°C compared with cooler Taccl treatments, as observed in previous acclimation studies on subtropical birds. We found no variation in the reaction norms of BMR and EWL among populations in response to acclimation, suggesting previously documented differences in seasonal BMR acclimatization are the result of phenotypic flexibility. In contrast to higher-latitude species, Msum did not significantly vary in response to thermal acclimation. These findings support the idea that factors other than enhancing cold tolerance may be driving patterns of metabolic variation in subtropical birds.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed; transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method of data analysis.|Participating clinicians had been in practice for an average of 12.8 years (range = 1-36 y). Patients had a mean age of 84.0 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.7); caregivers had a mean age of 67.0 years (SD = 9.3). There was wide variability in current practices for identifying caregivers' needs and risks, encompassing direct and indirect approaches, when such issues are considered. Participants posited that integrating standardized caregiver assessment into primary care delivery could help improve patient care, enhance clinician-caregiver communication, and validate caregivers' efforts. Barriers to assessment included insufficient time and reimbursement, liability concerns, lack of awareness of community resources, and concerns about patient autonomy. To facilitate future uptake of caregiver assessment, participants recommended brief self-administered assessment tools and post-screen discussions with practice staff.|Identification of caregivers' needs and risks in primary care is highly variable. Integration of standardized caregiver assessment into practice requires coordinated changes to policy, revision of practice workflows, and an interdisciplinary approach to the development of appropriate assessment tools.

32204468	<TITLE>Chemical and Physical Characteristics of Edible Films, Based on κ- and ι-Carrageenans with the Addition of Lapacho Tea Extract.</TITLE>The aim of the study was to characterize antioxidant and textural property differences of edible films prepared with the addition of lapacho extract (LE). The experimentally produced edible films also contained different carrageenans (ι- and κ-carrageenan). The κ- and ι-carrageenan, glycerol and the different addition of LE (5%, 10%, 20%) were used as ingredients for forming films. The pH and viscosity were measured for film forming solutions (before drying). The following analyses were performed on films: the total polyphenol content (TPC), Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and 2-Diphenyl-1-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Optical parameters were analyzed by the determination of UV-Vis spectra. The structure of films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The gained results indicated that the use of different gelling agents (ι- and κ-carrageenan) resulted in statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in textural properties (strength and breaking strain) of produced edible films. The highest antioxidant properties and TPC had a κ film with 20% LE (DPPH: 87.63 ± 0.03%; TPC: 233.75 ± 0.104 mg gallic acid/g). According to these results, it can be concluded that edible films with the highest concentrations of added lapacho extract can serve as a good source of antioxidant compounds. Certainly, these properties can be usefully incorporated into the wrapped food commodity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
32248112	<TITLE>Reply to "Energy Optimal Stimulation Waveforms, Or Not: Comments on 'An Investigation of Neural Stimulation Efficiency With Gaussian Waveforms'".</TITLE>We thank Professors Grill and Wongsarnpigoon for their detailed responses prompted by our recent publication [1] in this journal. We welcome the opportunity we have had for discussion and thank the Editor for his invitation to make this further contribution. We made our experiments partly in the light of the statements in the abstract of their relevant paper [2] that energy optimal genetic algorithm (GA) waveforms "resembled truncated Gaussian curves" and that "if used in implantable neural stimulators, GA-optimized waveforms could prolong battery life, thereby reducing the frequency of recharge intervals, the volume of implanted pulse generators, and the costs and risks of battery-replacement surgeries." The authors discussed the practical consequences of both a 5% increase and a 60% increase in energy efficiency in the final statement of the paper and acknowledged that to include the cost of generating the GA waveforms might change the predicted optimal shape. Although mentioned only once, a claim of up to 60% relative energy savings is of great interest to those who design and use neural stimulators. Based on our in-vivo investigation of neural stimulation efficiency with biphasic Gaussian waveforms, we reported an upper potential of 17% energy savings over rectangular biphasic pulses. Furthermore, we added the consideration of instantaneous power requirement in our paper to further inform this discussion. This is a crucial parameter, especially to set the practical performance of the sharp-peaked GA waveforms into perspective, given that they deliver the majority of the cathodic charge in a time much shorter than the nominal phase duration.

32288041	<TITLE>Energy performance of independent air dehumidification systems with energy recovery measures.</TITLE>Independent air dehumidification provides an attractive alternative to traditional coupled air dehumidification with reduced energy use, better humidity control and indoor air quality. According to this concept, latent load is treated by an independent system and the sensible load is treated by chilled-ceiling panels. In this work, four independent air dehumidification systems with energy recovery strategies are proposed. They are as follows: system 1, mechanical dehumidification with heat pump; system 2, mechanical dehumidification with sensible heat exchanger; system 3, mechanical dehumidification with membrane-based total heat exchanger; and system 4: a heat pump incorporating an active desiccant wheel and evaporative cooler. They are compared with a mechanical dehumidification system with no heat recovery. Hour-by-hour energy analysis is performed on the systems proposed. The results show that the system of mechanical dehumidification with membrane total heat recovery (system 3) consumes the least primary energy. However, since, the systems employ energy recovery measures, the energy savings for the four systems are in the same order, around 4.40×106 kJ per person.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

32354368	<TITLE>PRECISE pregnancy cohort: challenges and strategies in setting up a biorepository in sub-Saharan Africa.</TITLE>PRECISE is a population-based, prospective pregnancy cohort study designed for deep phenotyping of pregnancies in women with placenta-related disorders, and in healthy controls. The PRECISE Network is recruiting ~ 10,000 pregnant women in three countries (The Gambia, Kenya, and Mozambique) representing sub-Saharan Africa. The principal aim is to improve our understanding of pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. This involves the creation of a highly curated biorepository for state of the art discovery science and a rich database of antenatal variables and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our overarching aim is to provide large sample numbers with adequate power to address key scientific questions. Here we describe our experience of establishing a biorepository in the PRECISE Network and review the issues and challenges surrounding set-up, management and scientific use.|The feasibility of collecting and processing each sample type was assessed in each setting and plans made for establishing the necessary infrastructure. Quality control (QC) protocols were established to ensure that biological samples are 'fit-for-purpose'. The management structures required for standardised sample collection and processing were developed. This included the need for transport of samples between participating countries and to external academic/commercial institutions.|Numerous practical challenges were encountered in setting up the infrastructure including facilities, staffing, training, cultural barriers, procurement, shipping and sample storage. Whilst delaying the project, these were overcome by establishing good communication with the sites, training workshops and constant engagement with the necessary commercial suppliers. A Project Executive Committee and Biology Working Group together defined the biospecimens required to answer the research questions paying particular attention to harmonisation of protocols with other cohorts so as to enable cross-biorepository collaboration. Governance structures implemented include a Data and Sample Committee to ensure biospecimens and data will be used according to consent, and prioritisation by scientific excellence. A coordinated sample and data transfer agreement will prevent delay in sample sharing.|With adequate training and infrastructure, it is possible to establish high quality sample collections to facilitate research programmes such as the PRECISE Network in sub-Saharan Africa. These preparations are pre-requisites for effective execution of a biomarker-based approach to better understand the complexities of placental disease in these settings, and others.

Secondary bacterial pneumonia can follow the initial phase of viral respiratory infection or occur during the recovery phase. No obvious pattern or guidelines exist for viral co-infection, combined viral and bacterial pneumonia, or secondary bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19. Based on existing clinical data and experience with similar viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV, the management approach in COVID-19 should, ideally, take into consideration the overall presentation and the trajectory of illness.

32422680	<TITLE>Thr90Ser Mutation in Antithrombin is Associated with Recurrent Thrombosis in a Heterozygous Carrier.</TITLE>Antithrombin (AT) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of coagulation proteases of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. We identified an AT-deficient patient with a heterozygous Thr90Ser (T90S) mutation who experiences recurrent venous thrombosis. To understand the molecular basis of the clotting defect, we expressed AT-T90S in mammalian cells, purified it to homogeneity, and characterized its properties in established kinetics, binding, and coagulation assays. The possible effect of mutation on the AT structure was also evaluated by molecular modeling. Results demonstrate the inhibitory activity of AT-T90S toward thrombin and factor Xa has been impaired three- to fivefold in both the absence and presence of heparin. The affinity of heparin for AT-T90S has been decreased by four- to fivefold. Kinetic analysis revealed the stoichiometry of AT-T90S inhibition of both thrombin and factor Xa has been elevated by three- to fourfold in both the absence and presence of heparin, suggesting that the reactivity of coagulation proteases with AT-T90S has been elevated in the substrate pathway. The anticoagulant activity of AT-T90S has been significantly impaired as analyzed in the AT-deficient plasma supplemented with AT-T90S. The anti-inflammatory effect of AT-T90S was also decreased. Structural analysis predicts the shorter side-chain of Ser in AT-T90S has a destabilizing effect on the structure of AT and/or the AT-protease complex, possibly increasing the size of an internal cavity and altering a hydrogen-bonding network that modulates conformations of the allosterically linked heparin-binding site and reactive center loop of the serpin. This mutational effect increases the reactivity of AT-T90S with coagulation proteases in the substrate pathway.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
32458521	<TITLE>Multigene testing in breast cancer: What have we learned from the 21-gene recurrence score assay?</TITLE>Most invasive breast cancers express hormone receptors (HR) and typically have a favorable prognosis following endocrine therapy. Patients at a higher risk of recurrence can be identified by multigene prognostic classifiers such as the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay, 70-gene prognostic signature, PAM-50, 12-gene molecular score, and others. The 21-gene RS assay (Oncotype Dx™, Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) has level I clinical evidence and is the most widely used multigene assay in North America. The RS assay is based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that can be performed on the RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. It evaluates the expression of 16 cancer-related genes developed based on a multi-step approach. Due to its ability to assess recurrence risk and predict potential benefit from chemotherapy, the assay is recommended for patients with node-negative, HR-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology clinical practice guidelines, and St. Gallen consensus panel guidelines. The RS assay has also been incorporated in the prognostic stage groups in the 8th edition of the American Joint Commission of Cancer staging manual in order to provide essential genomic information for optimal treatment decisions. This review will focus on the utility of the RS assay in HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients, including risk of distant and locoregional recurrence in node-negative and node-positive tumors, association with radiotherapy, special subtypes of breast cancer, practical issues related to selecting tumors for testing, and overview of the recently published TailorX (Trial Assigning IndividuaLized Options for treatment [Rx]) results.

32544839	<TITLE>Bioprocessing strategies to increase the protein fraction of Rhizopus oryzae biomass using fish industry sidestreams.</TITLE>The sidestreams produced during fish processing end in a separation tank where the resulting fractions follow biogas production or wastewater treatment. These streams can alternatively be used for production of protein-rich fungal biomass for e.g. fish feed applications, a product in increasing demand. These streams and upper streams originated during fish processing were used in this study for production of biomass using the edible filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae. The COD of the streams varied between 11 and 54 kg/m3 and, after fungal conversion of organic matter into protein-rich biomass and separation, a reduction of 34-69% was achieved. The stream origin had an effect on the final production and composition of the fungal biomass: 480 kg of biomass containing 33% protein per ton of COD were produced after cultivation in the separation tank streams, while 220 kg of biomass containing 62% protein per ton of COD were produced in upper sidestreams with lower amounts of suspended solids. Changing the initial pH (6.1-6.5) to 5.0 had a negative influence on the amount of biomass produced while medium supplementation had no influence. Thus, fish processing sidestreams can be diverted from biogas production and wastewater treatment to the production of protein-rich biomass for feed applications.

32552507	<TITLE>The non-linear relationship between sum of 7 skinfolds and fat and lean mass in elite swimmers.</TITLE>Body composition can substantially impact elite swimming performance. In practice, changes in fat and lean mass of elite swimmers are estimated using body mass, sum of seven skinfolds (∑7) and lean mass index (LMI). However, LMI may be insufficiently accurate to detect small changes in body composition which could meaningfully impact swimming performance. This study developed equations which estimate dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived lean and fat mass using body mass and ∑7 data. Elite Australian swimmers (n = 44; 18 male, 26 female) completed a DXA scan and standardised body mass and ∑7 measurements. Equations to estimate DXA-derived lean and fat mass based on body mass, ∑7 and sex were developed. The relationships between ∑7, body mass and DXA-derived lean and fat mass were non-linear. Fat mass (Adjusted R2 = 0.91; standard error = 1.0 kg) and lean mass (Adjusted R2 = 0.99; standard error = 1.0 kg) equations were considered sufficiently accurate. Lean mass estimates outperformed the LMI in identifying the correct direction of change in lean mass (82% correct; LMI 71%). Using the accurate estimations produced by these equations will enhance the prescription and evaluation of programmes to optimise the body composition and subsequent performance in swimmers.

32593096	<TITLE>Responses of Hydrocharis dubia (Bl.) Backer and Trapa bispinosa roxb. to tetracycline exposure.</TITLE>The presence of tetracycline is ubiquitous and has adverse effects on aquatic systems. A hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the ecological sensitivity of Hydrocharis dubia (Bl.) Backer and Trapa bispinosa Roxb. Exposed to different concentrations of tetracycline (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 30 and 50 mg/L) for one day (1D) and 14 days (14D). The results showed that after 1D of tetracycline exposure, the physiological indices of H. dubia had no remarkable change except for proline which was significantly stimulated under 0.1 mg/L tetracycline. For T. bispinosa, guaiacol peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and protein and proline content were notably promoted under different concentrations of tetracycline, but PPO activity was significantly decreased in 50 mg/L. After 14D, tetracycline caused no harm to the growth and protein content of H. dubia, but negatively influenced lipid peroxidation product and chlorophyll content in H. dubia under high tetracycline concentrations. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and POD activity of H. dubia significantly increased at high tetracycline concentrations, while catalase (CAT) and PPO activity significantly decreased. APX activity in H. dubia increased with tetracycline concentrations at low tetracycline concentrations. For T. bispinosa, high concentrations of tetracycline application significantly inhibited its growth and the content of protein and chlorophyll. SOD, POD, CAT, and PPO activity of T. bispinosa were induced under different concentrations of tetracycline and no lipid peroxidation was observed. APX activity in T. bispinosa was significantly inhibited at high tetracycline concentrations. The results suggest that tetracycline can cause oxidative damage in H. dubia but harm the metabolism process of T. bispinosa without inducing oxidative damage. Overall, the sensitivity of T. bispinosa exposed to tetracycline exposure is higher than that of H. dubia.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
32597125	<TITLE>Bioassay and alpha spectrometry in indirect monitoring of Spanish workers exposed to enriched uranium.</TITLE>Workers at risk of exposure to uranium compounds should be monitored and their internal exposure quantified in terms of committed effective dose E(50) in mSv. In vitro bioassay methods can quantify uranium in urine and faeces at low activity levels. Alpha spectrometry (AS) is the most common method used for monitoring alpha-emitting radionuclides in internal dosimetry services. It provides isotopic information and low minimum detectable activity (MDA) values (≤0.50 mBq per sample). This study reports the results of a five-year monitoring of workers exposed to uranium at a Spanish Juzbado facility, which produces nuclear fuel elements enriched with up to 5 % of 235U. Monitoring included about 100 workers per year, most of whom had worked at the facility for more than 10 years before the individual monitoring programme was established. We analysed nearly 550 samples of more than 200 workers over five years. The obtained results indicate that workers were adequately protected from uranium exposure through inhalation and had an acceptably low chronic intake at the facility.

32597966	<TITLE>Asymmetric dimerization of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA facilitates substrate recognition.</TITLE>Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are enzymes that convert adenosine to inosine in duplex RNA, a modification that exhibits a multitude of effects on RNA structure and function. Recent studies have identified ADAR1 as a potential cancer therapeutic target. ADARs are also important in the development of directed RNA editing therapeutics. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of the ADAR reaction will advance efforts to develop ADAR inhibitors and new tools for directed RNA editing. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of a fragment of human ADAR2 comprising its deaminase domain and double stranded RNA binding domain 2 (dsRBD2) bound to an RNA duplex as an asymmetric homodimer. We identified a highly conserved ADAR dimerization interface and validated the importance of these sequence elements on dimer formation via gel mobility shift assays and size exclusion chromatography. We also show that mutation in the dimerization interface inhibits editing in an RNA substrate-dependent manner for both ADAR1 and ADAR2.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

However, existing healthy-subjects studies have been equivocal in demonstrating KAM reduction with valgus knee bracing.|What are the immediate effects of valgus bracing at different tension levels on KAM during walking at a controlled speed and does body height modify the brace-KAM associations?|Data from 32 knee-healthy participants were analysed in this randomized crossover trial. Participants performed walking trials at controlled speed (1.3 ± 0.065 m/s) both with and without an Ossür Unloader One® brace. During the bracing condition, valgus tension was incrementally increased, from zero tension to normal tension and to maximum tolerable tension.|Valgus bracing minimally increased knee flexion at heel-strike (P < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner and minimally reduced gait velocity (∼0.015m/s) across all tension levels. Valgus bracing, overall, did not significantly reduce the various KAM measures. However, brace use at maximal tension was associated with a 0.04Nm/kg (9.2 %) increase in first peak KAM amongst participants with a body height of 1.75 m and a 0.03Nm/kg (7.6 %) decrease in first peak KAM amongst participants with a body height of 1.55 m.|Valgus bracing did not reduce the various KAM measures during walking; however, body height may play a moderating role. Given knee brace sizes vary more in circumference than length, this result may be due to the ratio between effective moment arm length relative to limb length. A deeper understanding of the potential neuro-biomechanical effects of valgus knee bracing and how these effects are potentially modified by body height may be critical to the design of effective knee braces.

32629749	<TITLE>Use sonoelastography to predict the reparability of large-to-massive rotator cuff tears.</TITLE>Most symptomatic large-to-massive rotator cuff tears (RCTs) should be operated, but the surgical reparability depended on the degree of rotator cuff muscle atrophy or fatty infiltration. The orthopedic surgeons will decide whether the teared stump is reparable during the surgery, but preoperative evaluation can be done by some assessment tools. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in recent studies to predict the reparability of large-to-massive RCTs, but the clinical availability was not as good as ultrasound. We hypothesize that the ultrasound elastography can predict the reparability of large-to-massive RCTs.|This is a prospective observational study and participants with large-to-massive RCTs who are going to have surgeries will be included. Out investigators will evaluate the shoulder passive range of motion (ROM) and strength of all participants. Participants' degree of shoulder pain and activities of daily living (ADLs) will be assessed by American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. The ultrasound elastography will be used to evaluate the tissue quality of supraspinatus muscle and infraspinatus muscle. To test the reliability of the ultrasound elastography, two physicians will perform the ultrasound elastography independently and twenty participants will be selected for the reliability test. Besides, MRI will be used to evaluate the size of tear, the degree of tendon retraction, fatty infiltration of rotator cuff muscles, and muscle atrophy. Finally, the orthopedic surgeons will perform surgeries and decide whether the teared stump can be completely repaired intraoperatively. The primary analysis is the predictive validity of ultrasound elastography for the reparability of large-to-massive RCTs. Before the predictive validity of ultrasound elastography is measured, our investigators will assess the reliability of ultrasound elastography when administered to cases with large-to-massive RCTs, and we will check the correlations between the findings of ultrasound elastography and MRI.|The outcome will provide the evidence of ultrasound elastography for preoperative evaluation of large-to-massive RCTs.

International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action.|We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution.|While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.

32715316	<TITLE>Plasmid-Mediated Biodegradation of Chlorpyrifos and Analysis of Its Metabolic By-Products.</TITLE>Organophosphate pesticide persistence is an emerging menace to the environment and despite this fact, its use has been enhanced due to its high efficiency. Bioremediation using microorganisms would be the only means by which these hazardous compounds could be wiped out without disturbing the environmental harmony. The current work studied the molecular mechanism of degradation of Chlorpyrifos (CP) by a bacterial consortium C5 comprising of three soil isolates Staphylococcus warneri (CPI 2), Pseudomonas putida (CPI 9) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (CPI 15), which unveiled that the property is plasmid borne. All the isolates were found to possess a 4 kb plasmid which could be cured only by using sodium azide. The Escherichia coli JM109 cells when transformed individually with the plasmid of the isolates showed CP degradation in mineral salts medium (MSM) that contained CP as the sole carbon source. The degradative enzyme organophosphorus hydrolase (~ 60 KDa) of the isolates was extracted and purified to 31.85, 26 and 37.74 fold, respectively. The possible metabolic by-products of CP degradation by the consortium C5, were also analysed. The LC-Q-Tof MS analysis revealed the presence of the major metabolite 3, 5, 6 -trichloropyridine (TCP) with the formation of chlorpyrifos oxon as the intermediate.

Excitonic features of four excitons (A, B, C, and D) were observed in the optical spectra of the Sb2Se3 single crystals and in the photoelectric spectra of the Me-Sb2Se3 structures. The exciton parameters, such as the ground (n = 1) and excited (n = 2) state positions and the binding energy (Ry), were determined. The effective mass of the electrons at the bottom of the conduction band (m c * = 0.67m 0) as well as the holes at the four top valence bands (m v1 * = 3.32m 0, m v2 * = 3.83m 0, m v3 * = 3.23m 0 and m v4 * = 3.23m 0) were calculated in the Г-point of the Brillouin zone. The magnitude of the valence band splitting V1-V2 due to the spin-orbit interaction (Δso = 35 meV) and the crystal field (Δcf = 13 meV) were estimated in the Brillouin zone center. The energy splitting between the bands V3-V4 was 191 meV. The identified features were discussed based on both the theoretically calculated energy band structure and the excitonic band symmetry in the Brillouin zone (k = 0) for crystals with an orthorhombic symmetry (Рnma). The photoelectric properties of the Me-Sb2S3 structures were investigated in the spectral range 1-1.8 eV under E||c and E⟂c polarization conditions and at different applied voltages.

32928653	<TITLE>Review: Why screen for severe combined immunodeficiency disease?</TITLE>Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is now routinely performed in many countries across Europe and around the world. The number of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) reflects T cell levels. TREC quantification is possible using dried blood spot (DBS) samples already collected from newborns to screen for other conditions. This method is very sensitive and highly specific. Data in the literature show that the survival rate for children with SCID is much higher when the disease is detected through early screening, as opposed to a later diagnosis. Newborns diagnosed with SCID may receive the appropriate care quickly, before the onset of serious infectious complications, which raises survival rates, improves quality of life, and limits side effects and treatment costs. At the request of the French Ministry of Health, France's National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé) is expected to issue recommendations on this topic soon. The nationwide DEPISTREC study, involving 48 maternity units across France, showed that routine SCID screening is feasible and effective. Such screening offers the additional benefit of also diagnosing non-SCID lymphopenia within the infant population.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

All unaccompanied immigrant minors were screened for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and latent tuberculosis infection.|A total of 879 unaccompanied immigrant minors, 858 males and 21 females, aged 13-18 years old were studied. Of these, 615 were from Africa, 179 from Asia and 84 from Eastern Europe. A low prevalence of HBsAg carriage (2.5%) was observed as was very low prevalence of hepatitis C (0.72%) and latent syphilis (0.4%); latent tuberculosis, defined as tuberculin skin test (TST)+ X-ray case, was diagnosed in 102 (12%) minors.|Similar to previous studies, these data demonstrate that migrant minors are generally healthy. However, given the relatively high prevalence of hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis, systematic screening for these diseases among immigrant minors immigrants is highly recommended for early detection and treatment of potentially transmissible diseases.

32958382	<TITLE>Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone.</TITLE>Patients with flank pain and hematuria are common emergency department presentations of nephrolithiasis. We may anchor on this etiology and potentially miss other less common differentials. We present a case of a patient with hematuria and flank pain typical of nephrolithiasis who was diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension. A 50 year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. We pursued a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and found a left renal subcapsular hematoma on non-contrast CT. A CTA was done with no active hemorrhage found. The patient had no history of recent trauma and was found to be hypertensive on evaluation. Urology was consulted and management for the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page Kidney and admitted to medicine for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Page Kidney is a diagnosis that describes compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass causing secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment may involve conservative measures including hypertension management, or more invasive measures like evacuation or nephrectomy. We describe the case of a patient presumed to have nephrolithiasis presenting with typical left-sided flank pain, diagnosed with Page kidney, and treated conservatively.

32960579	<TITLE>Collision-Induced Unfolding Differentiates Functional Variants of the KCNQ1 Voltage Sensor Domain.</TITLE>The KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channel regulates the repolarization of cardiac cells, and a plurality of point mutations in its voltage-sensing domain (VSD) are associated with toxic gain or loss of pore function, resulting in disease. As is the case with many disease-associated membrane proteins, there are hundreds of human variants of interest identified for KCNQ1; however, a significant portion of these variants have not been characterized in relation to their functional and disease associations. Additionally, as the VSD consists of four transmembrane helices, studies into dynamic structural differences among KCNQ1 VSD variants are hindered by the current limitations and deficits in the high-resolution structure determination of membrane proteins. Here, we use native ion mobility-mass spectrometry and collision-induced unfolding (CIU) to address the need for a high throughput-compatible method for the structural characterization of membrane protein variants of unknown significance using the KCNQ1 VSD as a model system. We perform CIU on wild-type and three mutant KCNQ1 VSD forms associated with the toxic gain or loss of function and show through both automated feature detection and comprehensive difference analysis of the CIU data sets that the variants are clearly grouped by function and disease association. We also construct a classification scheme based on the CIU data sets, which is able to differentiate the variant functional groups and classify a recently characterized variant to its correct grouping. Further, we probe the stability of the KCNQ1 VSD variants when liberated from C12E8 micelles at pH 8.0 and find preliminary evidence that the R231C mutation associated with the gain of the pore function is destabilized relative to the wild-type and loss of function variants.

32969011	<TITLE>Risk of Harm Associated With Using Rapid Sequence Induction Intubation and Positive Pressure Ventilation in Patients With Hemorrhagic Shock.</TITLE>Based on limited published evidence, physiological principles, clinical experience, and expertise, the author group has developed a consensus statement on the potential for iatrogenic harm with rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation and positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) on patients in hemorrhagic shock. "In hemorrhagic shock, or any low flow (central hypovolemic) state, it should be noted that RSI and PPV are likely to cause iatrogenic harm by decreasing cardiac output." The use of RSI and PPV leads to an increased burden of shock due to a decreased cardiac output (CO)2 which is one of the primary determinants of oxygen delivery (DO2). The diminishing DO2 creates a state of systemic hypoxia, the severity of which will determine the magnitude of the shock (shock dose) and a growing deficit of oxygen, referred to as oxygen debt. Rapid accumulation of critical levels of oxygen debt results in coagulopathy and organ dysfunction and failure. Spontaneous respiration induced negative intrathoracic pressure (ITP) provides the pressure differential driving venous return. PPV subsequently increases ITP and thus right atrial pressure. The loss in pressure differential directly decreases CO and DO2 with a resultant increase in systemic hypoxia. If RSI and PPV are deemed necessary, prior or parallel resuscitation with blood products is required to mitigate post intervention reduction of DO2 and the potential for inducing cardiac arrest in the critically shocked patient.

32978385	<TITLE>Face selective patches in marmoset frontal cortex.</TITLE>In humans and macaque monkeys, socially relevant face processing is accomplished via a distributed functional network that includes specialized patches in frontal cortex. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, who diverged ~35 million years from Old World primates. The common marmoset is a New World primate species ideally placed to address this question given their complex social repertoire. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a putative high-level face processing network in marmosets. Like Old World primates, marmosets show differential activation in anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices while they view socially relevant videos of marmoset faces. We corroborate the locations of these frontal regions by demonstrating functional and structural connectivity between these regions and temporal lobe face patches. Given the evolutionary separation between macaques and marmosets, our results suggest this frontal network specialized for social face processing predates the separation between Platyrrhini and Catarrhini.

The objective of this study was to quantify and describe US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic.|We analyzed cross-sectional responses collected from a nationally representative and long-running panel survey of US adults conducted in late May and early June 2020 (response rate = 70%). The survey included questions about dental care delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, purpose of the delayed dental visits, timing of future dental visits, and demographic information. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to determine if rates of delayed dental care varied by subgroup. A multivariable regression model, adjusted for age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, census division, and rurality, was estimated to predict the odds of reporting delayed dental care.|Nearly half of respondents (46.7%) reported delaying going to the dentist or receiving dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among adults who reported delaying dental care due to the pandemic, 74.7% reported delaying a checkup, 12.4% reported delaying care to address something that was bothering them, and 10.5% reported delaying care to get planned treatment. About 44.4% of adults reported that they planned to visit the dentist within the next 3 mo. In the multivariable regression model, only living in an urban (vs. rural) area was associated with significantly higher odds of delayed dental care due to the pandemic (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 2.1).|Nearly half of US adults reported delaying dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring of 2020. Our results offer insight into the experiences of patients seeking dental care this spring and the economic challenges faced by dental providers due to the pandemic.|This article describes US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

32998448	<TITLE>High-Titer Lactic Acid Production by Pediococcus acidilactici PA204 from Corn Stover through Fed-Batch Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation.</TITLE>Lignocellulose comprised of cellulose and hemicellulose is one of the most abundant renewable feedstocks. Lactic acid bacteria have the ability to ferment sugar derived from lignocellulose. In this study, Pediococcus acidilactici PA204 is a lactic acid bacterium with a high tolerance of temperature and high-efficiency utilization of xylose. We developed a fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process at 37 °C (pH 6.0) using the 30 FPU (filter paper units)/g cellulase and 20 g/L corn steep powder in a 5 L bioreactor to produce lactic acid (LA). The titer, yield, and productivity of LA produced from 12% (w/w) NaOH-pretreated and washed stover were 92.01 g/L, 0.77 g/g stover, and 1.28 g/L/h, respectively, and those from 15% NaOH-pretreated and washed stover were 104.11 g/L, 0.69 g/g stover, and 1.24 g/L/h, respectively. This study develops a feasible fed-batch SSF process for LA production from corn stover and provides a promising candidate strain for high-titer and -yield lignocellulose-derived LA production.

33011509	<TITLE>Parental exposure to polystyrene microplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations has negligible transgenerational effects on zebrafish (Danio rerio).</TITLE>Waterborne exposure to highly persistent microplastic pollutants is a major concern for aquatic species worldwide. There are still gaps in knowledge on microplastics' potential transgenerational effects on offspring generation. Using zebrafish, this study investigated the survival and early development of offspring through a 21-day continuous parental treatment with polystyrene microplastics. The results showed that continuous waterborne exposure to high concentrations (>100 μg/L) of polystyrene microplastics (1 μm) for 21 days resulted in notable microplastic accumulation in adult fish intestines. Exposure at microplastic concentrations greater than 100 μg/L also induced significant changes in steroidogenic mRNA expression in zebrafish gonads. However, no significant changes in the cumulative number of eggs spawned and fertilization rate were observed at any parental exposure concentrations when compared to the control. Early development of derived offspring, in terms of hatching rate, body length, malformation rate and mortality rate, did not significantly differ from that of the control. This study showed that transgenerational effects of parental exposure to polystyrene microplastics in zebrafish might be negligible or recoverable. This study provided new results and insights on the transgenerational effects of microplastics on a freshwater fish species and can help to understand impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems.

In adults with severe COVID-19, remdesivir compared with placebo probably improves recovery by a large amount (absolute risk difference [ARD] range, 7% to 10%) and may result in a small reduction in mortality (ARD range, -4% to 1%) and a shorter time to recovery or clinical improvement. Remdesivir may have little to no effect on hospital length of stay. Remdesivir probably reduces serious adverse events by a moderate amount (ARD range, -6% to -8%). Compared with a 10-day remdesivir course, a 5-day course may reduce mortality, increase recovery or clinical improvement by small to moderate amounts, reduce time to recovery, and reduce serious adverse events among hospitalized patients not requiring mechanical ventilation.

33018753	<TITLE>EEG spectro-temporal amplitude modulation as a measurement of cortical hemodynamics: an EEG-fNIRS study.</TITLE>Neurovascular coupling provides valuable descriptive information about neural function and communication. In this work, we propose to objectively characterize EEG sub-band modulation in an attempt to compare with local variations of fNIRS hemoglobin concentration. First, full-band EEG signals are decomposed into five well-known frequency sub-bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. The temporal amplitude envelope of each sub-band is then computed via Hilbert transformation. The proposed EEG 'spectro-temporal amplitude modulation' (EEG-AM) feature measures the rate at which each sub-band is modulated. Similarities between EEG-AM features and fNIRS hemoglobin concentration are computed for four neighboring channels over the occipital area during resting-state. Experiments with a database of 29 participants show statistically significant similarities between the total hemoglobin concentration and the alpha band modulating the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies. These results support the idea that the EEG-AM can carry hemodynamic properties.Clinical relevance- This shows that the EEG spectro-temporal amplitude modulation present similarities with the hemoglobin concentration in co-placed channels.

33042183	<TITLE>Integrating Conventional and Participatory Crop Improvement for Smallholder Agriculture Using the Seeds for Needs Approach: A Review.</TITLE>In response to the climate change, it is essential to provide smallholder farmers with improved field crop genotypes that may increase the resilience of their farming system. This requires a fast turnover of varieties in a system capable of injecting significant amounts of genetic diversity into productive landscapes. Crop improvement is a pivotal strategy to cope with and adapt to climate change. Modern breeding may rely on the genomics revolution to speed up the development of new varieties with adaptive potential. However, centralized breeding may not adequately address smallholder farmers' needs for more locally acclimatized varieties or groups of varieties. This, in turn, constrains adoption of new varieties that reduces the effectiveness of a resource-intensive breeding process, an issue that may be overcome with participatory, decentralized approaches. Whether high-tech centralized breeding or decentralized participatory approaches are better suited for smallholder farmers in the global South is hotly debated. Sidestepping any false dichotomies and ideological issues in these debates, this review provides a perspective on relevant advances in a breeding approach that combines the two approaches and uses genomics for trait mining from ex situ collections of genetic materials, participatory multilocation trials and crowdsourced citizen science. It argues that this new combination of high-tech centralized and participatory decentralized methods can provide a coherent and effective approach to breeding for climate adaptation and the present review advocates on a different way forward for the future research.

33178447	<TITLE>Evaluation of a novel strategy to implement exercise evidence into clinical practice in breast cancer care: protocol for the NEXT-BRCA randomised controlled trial.</TITLE>The burden of breast cancer in Canada is steadily growing. More women are surviving breast cancer, yet, survivors live with side effects for years after treatments have ended. The benefits of exercise for women with breast cancer are well established and include improvement in treatment-related physical and emotional side effects. Despite these benefits, few survivors meet exercise guidelines. Exercise programmes are needed within the cancer institution in Canada to bridge the current knowledge to practice gap. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a novel implementation strategy that includes institution-based exercise plus self-management (SM) or SM alone versus usual care in improving exercise level, quality of life, aerobic capacity, muscle strength and use of healthcare services over 12 months for women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.|Participants: Women with stages I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Intervention: Group 1: institution-based exercise and SM (8 exercise sessions plus 8 SM modules); Group 2: SM alone; Group 3: usual care. Outcomes: The primary effectiveness outcome is minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and use of healthcare services. Randomisation: Participants will be randomised (1:1:1) to one of the three groups by a blinded statistician and will be stratified based on age of participant (<40, 40-60, and >60 years). Statistical analysis: Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, 6-month and 12-month follow-up using an analysis of covariance to test changes between groups over time adjusted for age.|This study addresses a long-standing need to help women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy become and stay more active by implementing novel rehabilitation strategies into real-world practice.

33183762	<TITLE>Critical Roles of Embryonic Born Dorsal Dentate Granule Neurons for Activity-Dependent Increases in BDNF, Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis, and Antianxiety-like Behaviors.</TITLE>Dentate gyrus (DG), a "gate" that controls information flow into the hippocampus, plays important roles in regulating both cognitive (e.g., spatial learning and memory) and mood behaviors. Deficits in DG neurons contribute to the pathogenesis of not only neurological, but also psychiatric, disorders, such as anxiety disorder. Whereas DG's function in spatial learning and memory has been extensively investigated, its role in regulating anxiety remains elusive.|Using c-Fos to mark DG neuron activation, we identified a group of embryonic born dorsal DG (dDG) neurons, which were activated by anxiogenic stimuli and specifically express osteocalcin (Ocn)-Cre. We further investigated their functions in regulating anxiety and the underlying mechanisms by using a combination of chemogenetic, electrophysiological, and RNA-sequencing methods.|The Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons were highly active in response to anxiogenic environment but had lower excitability and fewer presynaptic inputs than those of Ocn-Cre- or adult born dDG neurons. Activating Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons suppressed anxiety-like behaviors and increased adult DG neurogenesis, whereas ablating or chronically inhibiting Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons exacerbated anxiety-like behaviors, impaired adult DG neurogenesis, and abolished activity (e.g., voluntary wheel running)-induced anxiolytic effect and adult DG neurogenesis. RNA-sequencing screening for factors induced by activation of Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons identified BDNF, which was required for Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons mediated antianxiety-like behaviors and adult DG neurogenesis.|These results demonstrate critical functions of Ocn-Cre+ dDG neurons in suppressing anxiety-like behaviors but promoting adult DG neurogenesis, and both functions are likely through activation of BDNF.

33257690	<TITLE>Molecular subtype-specific responses of colon cancer cells to the SMAC mimetic Birinapant.</TITLE>Colorectal cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. Responses to genotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant or palliative setting vary greatly between patients, and colorectal cancer cells often resist chemotherapy by evading apoptosis. Antagonists of an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can restore defective apoptosis signaling by degrading cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins and by inhibition of XIAP. Due to the multiple molecular mechanisms-of-action of these targets, responses to IAP antagonist may differ between molecularly distinct colon cancer cells. In this study, responses to the IAP antagonist Birinapant and oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated in 14 colon cancer cell lines, representing the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). Treatment with Birinapant alone did not result in a substantial increase in apoptotic cells in this cell line panel. Annexin-V/PI assays quantified by flow cytometry and high-content screening showed that Birinapant increased responses of CMS1 and partially CMS3 cell lines to oxaliplatin/5-FU, whereas CMS2 cells were not effectively sensitized. FRET-based imaging of caspase-8 and -3 activation validated these differences at the single-cell level, with CMS1 cells displaying sustained activation of caspase-8-like activity during Birinapant and oxaliplatin/5-FU co-treatment, ultimately activating the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In CMS2 cell lines, Birinapant exhibited synergistic effects in combination with TNFα, suggesting that Birinapant can restore extrinsic apoptosis signaling in the context of inflammatory signals in this subtype. To explore this further, we co-cultured CMS2 and CMS1 colon cancer cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed increased cell death during Birinapant single treatment in these co-cultures, which was abrogated by anti-TNFα-neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, our study demonstrates that IAP inhibition is a promising modulator of response to oxaliplatin/5-FU in colorectal cancers of the CMS1 subtype, and may show promise as in the CMS2 subtype, suggesting that molecular subtyping may aid as a patient stratification tool for IAP antagonists in this disease.

33262074	<TITLE>In vitro induction of neoantigen-specific T cells in myelodysplastic syndrome, a disease with low mutational burden.</TITLE>Therapies that utilize immune checkpoint inhibition work by leveraging mutation-derived neoantigens and have shown greater clinical efficacy in tumors with higher mutational burden. Whether tumors with a low mutational burden are susceptible to neoantigen-targeted therapy has not been fully addressed. To examine the feasibility of neoantigen-specific adoptive T-cell therapy, the authors studied the T-cell response against somatic variants in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a malignancy with a very low tumor mutational burden. DNA and RNA from tumor (CD34+) and normal (CD3+) cells isolated from the patients' blood were sequenced to predict patient-specific MDS neopeptides. Neopeptides representing the somatic variants were used to induce and expand autologous T cells ex vivo, and these were systematically tested in killing assays to determine the proportion of neopeptides yielding neoantigen-specific T cells. The authors identified a total of 32 somatic variants (four to eight per patient) and found that 21 (66%) induced a peptide-specific T-cell response and 19 (59%) induced a T-cell response capable of killing autologous tumor cells. Of the 32 somatic variants, 11 (34%) induced a CD4+ response and 11 (34%) induced a CD8+ response that killed the tumor. These results indicate that in vitro induction of neoantigen-specific T cells is feasible for tumors with very low mutational burden and that this approach warrants investigation as a therapeutic option for such patients.

Conventionally, categorical scoring systems have been widely used to study flowering patterns, which are laborious and subjective to apply. The goal of this study was to develop a deep learning-based approach to characterize flowering patterns for cotton plants that flower progressively over several weeks, with flowers distributed across much of the plant.|A ground mobile system (GPhenoVision) was modified with a multi-view color imaging module, to acquire images of a plant from four viewing angles at a time. A total of 116 plants from 23 genotypes were imaged during an approximately 2-month period with an average scanning interval of 2-3 days, yielding a dataset containing 8666 images. A subset (475) of the images were randomly selected and manually annotated to form datasets for training and selecting the best object detection model. With the best model, a deep learning-based approach (DeepFlower) was developed to detect and count individual emerging blooms for a plant on a given date. The DeepFlower was used to process all images to obtain bloom counts for individual plants over the flowering period, using the resulting counts to derive flowering curves (and thus flowering characteristics). Regression analyses showed that the DeepFlower method could accurately (R2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 0.79) detect and count emerging blooms on cotton plants, and statistical analyses showed that imaging-derived flowering characteristics had similar effectiveness as manual assessment for identifying differences among genetic categories or genotypes.|The developed approach could thus be an effective and efficient tool to characterize flowering patterns for flowering plants (such as cotton) with complex canopy architecture.

33393563	<TITLE>Cleavage of cluster iron-sulfide bonds in cyclophane-coordinated FenSm complexes.</TITLE>Reaction of the tri(μ-sulfido)triiron(iii) tris(β-diketiminate) cyclophane complex, Fe3S3LEt/Me (1), or of the di(μ-sulfido)diiron(iii) complex Fe2S2HLEt/Me (5), with the related tri(bromide)triiron(ii) complex Fe3Br3LEt/Me (2) results in electron and ligand redistribution to yield the mixed-ligand multiiron complexes, including Fe3Br2SLEt/Me (3) and Fe2Br2SHLEt/Me (4). The cleavage and redistribution observed in these complexes is reminiscent of necessary Fe-S bond cleavage for substrate activation in nitrogenase enzymes, and provides a new perspective on the lability of Fe-S bonds in FeS clusters.

33514175	<TITLE>Engineering three-dimensional labyrinthine fractal acoustic metamaterials with low-frequency multi-band sound suppression.</TITLE>Acoustic metamaterials are a class of artificially periodic structures with extraordinary elastic properties that cannot be easily found in naturally occurring materials and can be applied to regulate the sound propagation behavior. The fractal configuration can be widely found in the acoustic system, like characterizing the broadband or multi-band sound propagation. This work will engineer three-dimensional (3D) labyrinthine fractal acoustic metamaterials (LFAMs) to regulate the sound propagation on subwavelength scales. The dispersion relations of LFAMs are systematically analyzed by the Bloch theory and the finite element method (FEM). The multi-bands, acoustic modes, and isotropic properties characterize their acoustic wave properties in the low-frequency regime. The effective bulk modulus and mass density of the LFAMs are numerically calculated to explain the low-frequency bandgap behaviors in specific frequencies. The transmissions and pressure field distributions of 3D LFAMs have been used to measure the ability for sound suppression. Furthermore, when considering the thermo-viscous loss on the transmission properties, the high absorptions occur within the multi-band range for low-frequency sound. Hence, this research contributes to potential applications on 3D LFAMs for multi-bands blocking and/or absorption on deep-subwavelength scales.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
33525500	<TITLE>Inhaled RNA Therapeutics for Obstructive Airway Diseases: Recent Advances and Future Prospects.</TITLE>Obstructive airway diseases, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the efficacy of currently available inhaled therapeutics is not sufficient for arresting disease progression and decreasing mortality, hence providing an urgent need for development of novel therapeutics. Local delivery to the airways via inhalation is promising for novel drugs, because it allows for delivery directly to the target site of action and minimizes systemic drug exposure. In addition, novel drug modalities like RNA therapeutics provide entirely new opportunities for highly specific treatment of airway diseases. Here, we review state of the art of conventional inhaled drugs used for the treatment of COPD and asthma with focus on quality attributes of inhaled medicines, and we outline the therapeutic potential and safety of novel drugs. Subsequently, we present recent advances in manufacturing of thermostable solid dosage forms for pulmonary administration, important quality attributes of inhalable dry powder formulations, and obstacles for the translation of inhalable solid dosage forms to the clinic. Delivery challenges for inhaled RNA therapeutics and delivery technologies used to overcome them are also discussed. Finally, we present future prospects of novel inhaled RNA-based therapeutics for treatment of obstructive airways diseases, and highlight major knowledge gaps, which require further investigation to advance RNA-based medicine towards the bedside.

33536767	<TITLE>Knowledge, Attitude and Practice on Hospital-Acquired Infection Prevention and Associated Factors Among Healthcare Workers at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.</TITLE>Hospital-acquired infections can be acquired by a patient or develop among hospital staff, as a more serious problem in low- and middle-income hospital settings. Assessing the level of knowledge, attitude and practice towards hospital-acquired infection prevention among healthcare workers and identifying the associated factors has an unquestionable importance of handling and management of these infections. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the knowledge, attitude and practice towards HAIs prevention and associated factors in healthcare workers at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, North West Ethiopia.|Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers towards HAIs prevention from January to June 2019. Each study participant was selected by simple random sampling. Data were collected using structured self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive analysis was used to present frequency and percentage of the main findings. The association between independent variables and KAP scores on HAI prevention was calculated using Pearson's Chi square and p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.|A total of 236 participants were included in this study with a 100% response rate; 90% and 57.2% of the participants had good knowledge and positive attitude towards HAI prevention, respectively. Meanwhile, only 36% of the study participants had good practice towards HAI prevention, suggesting less than satisfactory scores in this study. Level of education and work experience were significantly associated with safe-infection prevention attitude and practice (P value <0.005).|Even though the respondents have good knowledge with a sympathetic attitude about HAI preventions, good knowledge did not translate into prudent practices. Level of education and work experience were the independent risk factors towards HAI prevention of attitude and practice. Provision of continual on-job and off-job trainings together with strict implementation of updated standard operational procedures (SOP) may reduce the identified gap.

33561957	<TITLE>Efficient Feature Selection for Static Analysis Vulnerability Prediction.</TITLE>Common software vulnerabilities can result in severe security breaches, financial losses, and reputation deterioration and require research effort to improve software security. The acceleration of the software production cycle, limited testing resources, and the lack of security expertise among programmers require the identification of efficient software vulnerability predictors to highlight the system components on which testing should be focused. Although static code analyzers are often used to improve software quality together with machine learning and data mining for software vulnerability prediction, the work regarding the selection and evaluation of different types of relevant vulnerability features is still limited. Thus, in this paper, we examine features generated by SonarQube and CCCC tools, to identify those that can be used for software vulnerability prediction. We investigate the suitability of thirty-three different features to train thirteen distinct machine learning algorithms to design vulnerability predictors and identify the most relevant features that should be used for training. Our evaluation is based on a comprehensive feature selection process based on the correlation analysis of the features, together with four well-known feature selection techniques. Our experiments, using a large publicly available dataset, facilitate the evaluation and result in the identification of small, but efficient sets of features for software vulnerability prediction.

33627897	<TITLE>Finite Element Analysis of a Controlled Dynamization Device for External Circular Fixation.</TITLE>Objective  To virtually prototype a device for external circular fixation of long bone fractures with controlled dynamization made of two different materials and predict their mechanical behavior by using the finite element analysis (FEA) method. Method  A software was used for 3D modeling two metal parts closely attached by a sliding dovetail joint and a high-density silicone damper. Distinctive FEAs were simulated by considering two different materials (stainless steel or titanium), modes (locked or dynamized) and loading conditions (static/point or dynamic/0.5 sec) with uniform 150 kg axial load on top of the device. Results  The finite elements (FEs) model presented 81,872 nodes and 45,922 elements. Considering stainless steel, the maximum stress peak (140.98 MPa) was reached with the device locked under static loading, while the greatest displacement (2.415 × 10 -3 mm) was observed with the device locked and under dynamic loading. Regarding titanium, the device presented the maximum stress peak (141.45 MPa) under static loading and with the device locked, while the greatest displacement (3.975 × 10 -3 mm) was found with the device locked and under dynamic loading. Conclusion  The prototyped device played the role of stress support with acceptable deformation in both locked and dynamized modes and may be fabricated with both stainless steel and titanium.

33636059	<TITLE>Clinical significance of evaluation of collateral circulation in short-term prognosis of wake-up stroke patients.</TITLE>In recent years, the clinical significance of collateral circulation in vascular embolism has been gradually found.|To investigate the relationship between collateral circulation and short-term prognosis of wake-up stroke patients.|The present observational study enrolled 269 cases of wake-up ischemic stroke patients. All patients presented with mismatched low perfusion volume/main infraction volume and received thrombolytic therapy after admission. The hemorrhagic transformation rate was recorded. The American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) grading was used for evaluation of collateral circulation. The stroke condition was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The Barthel Index (BI) score was used for measurement of quality of life. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used for measurement of prognosis.|The hypertension, diabetes and current smoker rates were significantly higher. The baseline NHISS scores and NIHSS scores after 24 h were remarkably lower. The NIHSS scores were markedly lower in ASITN/SIR grade 2-3 patients compared with ASITN/SIR grade 0-1 patients at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months after treatment. Patients with ASITN/SIR grade 2-3 had lower mRS score and higher BI scores. The ASITN/SIR grade was an independent risk factor for bad prognosis of wake-up ischemic stroke patients in 3 months.|Collateral circulation condition may be associated with short-term prognosis of wake-up stroke patients. Patients with worse collateral circulation may present higher risk for bad short-term prognosis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
33795847	<TITLE>Mid-infrared radiative emission from bright hot plasmons in graphene.</TITLE>Carrier excitation and decay processes in graphene are of broad interest since relaxation pathways that are not present in conventional materials are enabled by a gapless Dirac electronic band structure. Here, we report that a previously unobserved decay pathway-hot plasmon emission-results in Fermi-level-dependent mid-infrared emission in graphene. Our observations of non-thermal contributions to Fermi-level-dependent radiation are an experimental demonstration of hot plasmon emission arising from a photo-inverted carrier distribution in graphene achieved via ultrafast optical excitation. Our calculations indicate that the reported plasmon emission process can be several orders of magnitude brighter than Planckian emission mechanisms in the mid-infrared spectral range. Both the use of gold nanodisks to promote scattering and localized plasmon excitation and polarization-dependent excitation measurements provide further evidence for bright hot plasmon emission. These findings define an approach for future work on ultrafast and ultrabright graphene emission processes and mid-infrared light source applications.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
33798864	<TITLE>Miscanthus as a carbon precursor for graphene oxide: A possibility influenced by pyrolysis temperature.</TITLE>This study investigates the potential of producing graphene oxide (GO) from biomass via green (comparatively) processing and the impact of graphitization temperature on GO quality. Our findings show that it is possible to convert biomass into highly pyrolytic biochar, followed by shear exfoliation to produce few-layer GO. However, pyrolysis temperature is key in ensuring that the biochar is suited for effective exfoliation. Low temperatures (<1000 °C) would preserve undesirable heterogenous, complex cellular structure of biomass whilst excessive temperatures (≥1300 °C) result in uncontrolled melting, coalescence and loss of functional groups. Results show 1200 °C to be the optimum graphitization temperature for miscanthus, where the resultant biochar is highly aromatic with sufficient functional groups to weaken van der Waals forces, thus facilitating exfoliation to form 6-layer GO with specific surface area of 545.3 m2g-1. This study demonstrates the potential of producing high quality, fit-for-purpose graphene materials from renewable sources.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
33844587	<TITLE>Lingual Exercise in Older Veterans With Dysphagia: A Pilot Investigation of Patient Adherence.</TITLE>Purpose Adherence is a concern in dysphagia management. Poor adherence with recommendations can negatively affect treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. For exercise-based therapies, low adherence can alter the dose of exercise delivered to the muscle, which can diminish impact of exercise. It has been established that low adherence is a problem in dysphagia treatments; however, relationships among levels of adherence and outcomes from exercise-based interventions have not been explored. Method In this retrospective pilot study, data were collected from a multicenter clinical demonstration program in the Veterans Affairs hospital system to examine the relationships between patient adherence with a device-facilitated lingual exercise regimen. Outcomes were compared pre- and posttreatment using a paired t test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, and relationships among adherence and outcome measures were evaluated using Pearson or Spearman rank correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Results Patient adherence was evenly distributed across participants: Adherence at the front sensor was 59.3% (SD = 28.2), ranging from 5.5% to 95.8%; the back sensor adherence was 55.9% (SD = 29.8), ranging from 1.1% to 97.2%. Maximum isometric pressure (MIP) generation, at both the front and back sensors, was increased from pre- to posttreatment (p < .0001, front; p = .008, back). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores were also significantly improved at the posttreatment time point as compared to baseline (p = .005). However, there were no significant correlations among adherence and outcome measures (front sensor adherence vs. ΔMIP, r = -.161, p = .342; back sensor adherence vs. ΔMIP, r = .002, p = .991; front sensor adherence vs. ΔFOIS, r = -.183, p = .279; back sensor adherence vs. ΔFOIS, r = -.160, p = .399). Conclusions These findings suggest that patient adherence with this lingual exercise program was not related to the increases in lingual pressure generation or improvement in functional oral intake observed in this cohort. These preliminary findings suggest the need for future, prospective, controlled, and randomized clinical trials to further investigate patient adherence with a lingual exercise program and related impacts of adherence on exercise dose and swallowing-related outcomes.

33864156	<TITLE>Determination of pharmaceuticals in solid samples in municipal wastewater treatment plants by online SPE LC-MS/MS using QuEChERS extraction.</TITLE>In this study, a pretreatment method based on the QuEChERS method has been applied for simultaneously extracting 27 residual pharmaceuticals from wastewater solids. The extracted compounds have been analyzed using online solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A recovery test was conducted according to the absorbent type, and buffers were added in the sample extraction step. The highest recovery efficiency could be observed when Na2SO4 was used as an absorbent and Na2EDTA was injected during the extraction process; the recovery efficiencies of the proposed method for the target compounds ranged from 61.3 to 137.2%, and the repeatability was 6.8%. These recovery and repeatability data showed that the proposed method could reliably analyze the 27 target residual pharmaceuticals. The concentrations of the target compounds were all below the limits of quantification: 830 ng g-1 for the target compounds in suspended solids, 2353 ng g-1 in activated sludge, and 1929 ng g-1 in waste sludge. The analytical method established in this study can be applied to quantify residual pharmaceuticals in solid samples and to investigate their behaviors in a municipal wastewater treatment plant.

33895360	<TITLE>Predictive Value of Bowel Ultrasound in Crohn's Disease: A 12-Month Prospective Study.</TITLE>Mucosal healing is associated with better outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD). Colonoscopy is invasive and poorly tolerated. Bowel ultrasound (US) is a noninvasive tool that increasingly is being used for CD assessment. We assessed the predictive role of baseline bowel US findings on disease course in a large prospective cohort of CD patients for 12 months.|Ileocolonic CD consecutive patients were followed up for 12 months after performing bowel US. The negative course of CD, defined as the need for steroids and/or change of therapy and/or hospitalization and/or the need for surgery, was assessed. We evaluated this composite end point and subsequently considered each individual end point separately. Predictors of negative disease course were analyzed by logistic regression analysis.|There were 225 ileal and/or colonic CD consecutive patients included in the study. We analyzed the association between baseline bowel US parameters and endoscopic activity (defined as a Simplified Endoscopic Activity score for CD > 2) to set up a noninvasive quantitative ultrasound-based score (bowel ultrasound score). The multivariable analysis identified the following independent predictors of a worse outcome throughout the 12-month period as follows: bowel ultrasound score greater than 3.52 (odds ratio [OR], 6.97; 95% CI, 2.87-16.93; P < .001), presence of at least 1 disease complication (stricture, fistula, abscess) at baseline bowel US (OR, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.21-12.53; P = .021), fecal calprotectin value of 250 μg/g or greater at baseline (OR, 5.43; 95% CI, 2.25-13.11; P < .001), and male sex (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.12-6.02; P = .025).|Bowel US predicts the 12-month course in CD.

33933650	<TITLE>Sphingolipids in HDL - Potential markers for adaptation to pregnancy?</TITLE>Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) exhibits many functions that render it an effective endothelial protective agent and may underlie its potential role in protecting the maternal vascular endothelium during pregnancy. In non-pregnant individuals, the HDL lipidome is altered in metabolic disease compared to healthy individuals and is linked to reduced cholesterol efflux, an effect that can be reversed by lifestyle management. Specific sphingolipids such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have been shown to mediate the vaso-dilatory effects of plasma HDL via interaction with the endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway. This review describes the relationship between plasma HDL and vascular function during healthy pregnancy and details how this is lost in pre-eclampsia, a disorder of pregnancy associated with widespread endothelial dysfunction. Evidence of a role for HDL sphingolipids, in particular S1P and ceramide, in cardiovascular disease and in healthy pregnancy and pre-eclampsia is discussed. Available data suggest that HDL-S1P and HDL-ceramide can mediate vascular protection in healthy pregnancy but not in preeclampsia. HDL sphingolipids thus are of potential importance in the healthy maternal adaptation to pregnancy.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
33982866	<TITLE>Cross-cultural representations of conjoined twins.</TITLE>Conjoined twinning is a rare birth defect estimated to occur in about 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births. The mechanism of conjoined twinning is not proven. Different forms of conjoined twinning are observed with the thoracopagus form being the most common. The rate of conjoined twinning is similar across all major populations. A dramatic malformation of this type would be an extraordinary occurrence leading people to reflect on the spiritual or supernatural nature of such an event. Therefore, it is not surprising that artifacts that seem to depict different forms of conjoined twins are seen across diverse cultures. In this article, we present a survey of these cultural artifacts including anatomic classification based on external anatomy and an exploration of the cultural and spiritual contexts associated with the artifacts. A key finding is that the most common form of conjoined twinning in the artifacts is parapagus (both dicephalus and diprosopus) in contrast to thoracopagus, the most common form in epidemiologic studies. Potential reasons for this difference are discussed. Evidence is presented to support the speculation that these objects represent artistic impressions of actual conjoined twinning events.

33997645	<TITLE>Naltrexone Initiation in the Inpatient Setting for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes.</TITLE>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent health issue in the United States. The number of those receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is limited, despite strong evidence for their effectiveness. The inpatient setting may represent an important opportunity to initiate MAT. The goal of this study was to summarize the data on naltrexone initiation in the emergency department or inpatient setting for the management of AUDs. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception through October 31, 2019. Search strategies were created using a combination of keywords (Supplemental Appendix 1, available online at http://www.mcpiqojournal.org) and standardized index terms related to naltrexone therapy for medically hospitalized patients with AUD. Two uncontrolled pre-post study designs evaluated naltrexone prescription rates, 30-day readmission rates, and rehospitalization rates. Two authors independently abstracted data on study characteristics, results, and study-level risk of bias. The research team collaborated to assess the strength of evidence across studies. Two studies reported that implementing a protocol for naltrexone initiation increased MAT rates, with one study noting a substantial decrease in 30-day hospital readmissions. Overall, we found that there is a paucity of data on naltrexone initiation in the inpatient setting for AUDs. This likely reflects the nature of current clinical practice and prescriber comfortability. There is a need for further studies evaluating MAT initiation in the inpatient setting. Furthermore, efforts to increase provider knowledge of these therapeutic options are in need of further exploration.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34002452	<TITLE>Bariatric surgery and the liver-Mechanisms, benefits, and risks.</TITLE>The prevalence of obesity and metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has risen dramatically over the past decades. At present, bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for this global health problem, through effects on food intake, gut hormone secretion, metabolic signaling pathways, and adipose tissue dysfunction. The liver occupies a central role in carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. Notably, a reduction in hepatic fat content and an improvement in hepatic insulin resistance are among the earliest beneficial effects of bariatric surgery, which has therefore emerged as an attractive treatment option for NAFLD. However, as the scope and popularity of weight loss surgery have expanded, new questions have arisen regarding its safety in patients with liver cirrhosis, the outcome of liver transplantation in patients with a history of bariatric surgery, and over incidental reports of liver failure following surgery. Studies in humans and rodents have also linked bariatric surgery to an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorder, a major risk factor for liver disease. This review integrates data from clinical and translational research to delineate both the beneficial impact of bariatric surgery on the liver and the potential risks involved.

34004250	<TITLE>Non-coding RNAs role in intracranial aneurysm: General principles with focus on inflammation.</TITLE>Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is one of the most challenging vascular lesions in the brain for clinicians. It was reported that 1%-6% of the world's population is affected by IAs. Owing to serious complications arising from these lesions, much attention has been paid to better understand their pathophysiology. Non-coding RNAs including short non-coding RNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have critical roles in modulating physiologic and pathological processes. These RNAs are emerging as new fundamental regulators of gene expression, are related with the progression of IA. Non-coding RNAs act via multiple mechanisms and be involved in vascular development, growth and remodeling. Furthermore, these molecules are involved in the regulation of inflammation, a key process in the formation and rupture of IA. Studying non-coding RNAs can yield a hypothetical mechanism for better understanding IA. The present study aims to focus on the role of these non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of IA.

34028970	<TITLE>Uncertainty in the positioning of patients receiving treatment for brain metastases and wearing surgical mask underneath thermoplastic mask during COVID-19 crisis.</TITLE>Thermoplastic masks, used along with surgical masks, enable immobilization methods to reduce the risk of infection in patients undergoing intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) during the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of thermoplastic mask immobilization with a surgical mask using an ExacTrac system. Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x-ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient's position at a couch angle of 0°. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non-coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non-coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79°), roll (1.24 vs 0.68°), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90°) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0°. Most of patient positioning errors were less than 1.0 mm or 1.0° after the couch was rotated to the planned angle for non-coplanar beams. The overall absolute values of the translational and rotational XV position errors with and without the surgical mask were less than 0.5 mm and 0.5°, respectively. This study showed that a thermoplastic mask with a surgical mask is a feasible immobilization technique for brain SRS/SRT patients using the ExacTrac system.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

The results of the current study revealed the drug-likeness and bioactive properties of the ligands.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34060151	<TITLE>Alternative Lone-Pair ns2 -Cation-Based Semiconductors beyond Lead Halide Perovskites for Optoelectronic Applications.</TITLE>Lead halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as advantageous high-performance optoelectronic semiconductors, and have undergone rapid development for diverse applications such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes , and photodetectors. While material instability and lead toxicity are still major concerns hindering their commercialization, they offer promising prospects and design principles for developing promising optoelectronic materials. The distinguished optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites stem from the Pb2+ cation with a lone-pair 6s2 electronic configuration embedded in a mixed covalent-ionic bonding lattice. Herein, we summarize alternative Pb-free semiconductors containing lone-pair ns2 cations, intending to offer insights for developing potential optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. We start with the physical underpinning of how the ns2 cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We then review the emerging Pb-free semiconductors containing ns2 cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.

34068615	<TITLE>Assessing the Real-Time Impact of COVID-19 on TB and HIV Services: The Experience and Response from Selected Health Facilities in Nairobi, Kenya.</TITLE>There was concern that the COVID-19 pandemic would adversely affect TB and HIV programme services in Kenya. We set up real-time monthly surveillance of TB and HIV activities in 18 health facilities in Nairobi so that interventions could be implemented to counteract anticipated declining trends. Aggregate data were collected and reported monthly to programme heads during the COVID-19 period (March 2020-February 2021) using EpiCollect5 and compared with monthly data collected during the pre-COVID period (March 2019-February 2020). During the COVID-19 period, there was an overall decrease in people with presumptive pulmonary TB (31.2%), diagnosed and registered with TB (28.0%) and in those tested for HIV (50.5%). Interventions to improve TB case detection and HIV testing were implemented from August 2020 and were associated with improvements in all parameters during the second six months of the COVID-19 period. During the COVID-19 period, there were small increases in TB treatment success (65.0% to 67.0%) and referral of HIV-positive persons to antiretroviral therapy (91.2% to 92.9%): this was more apparent in the second six months after interventions were implemented. Programmatic interventions were associated with improved case detection and treatment outcomes during the COVID-19 period, suggesting that monthly real-time surveillance is useful during unprecedented events.

A total of 216 28-week-old Hy-line Brown laying hens were divided into three dietary treatment groups, with six replicates of 12 birds each for 4 weeks. The control group (Ctr) was fed a basal diet and the treatment groups, T1 and T2, were fed a basal diet supplemented with B. subtilis at a dose rate of 5 × 108 CFU/kg and 2.5 × 109 CFU/kg, respectively. Dietary supplementation with B. subtilis did not significantly affect overall egg production in both groups, with no obvious changes in average egg weight and intestine morphology. B. subtilis administration also improved the physical barrier function of the intestine by inducing significantly greater expression levels of the tight junction protein occludin in T1 (p = 0.07) and T2 (p < 0.05). Further, supplementation with B. subtilis effectively modulated the cecal microbiota, increasing the relative level of beneficial bacteria at the genus level (e.g., Bifidobacterium&nbsp;p < 0.05, Lactobacillus p = 0.298, Bacillus&nbsp;p = 0.550) and decreasing the level of potential pathogens (e.g., Fusobacterium p < 0.05, Staphylococcus p < 0.05, Campylobacter p = 0.298). Overall, B. subtilis YW1 supplementation cannot significantly improve the egg production; however, it modulated the cecal microbiota towards a healthier pattern and promoted the mRNA expression of the tight junction protein occludin in laying hens, making B. subtilis YW1 a good probiotic candidate for application in the poultry industry, and further expanding the resources of strains of animal probiotics.

34077289	<TITLE>l2-Penalized temporal logit-mixed models for the estimation of regional obesity prevalence over time.</TITLE>Obesity is considered to be one of the primary health risks in modern industrialized societies. Estimating the evolution of its prevalence over time is an essential element of public health reporting. This requires the application of suitable statistical methods on epidemiologic data with substantial local detail. Generalized linear-mixed models with medical treatment records as covariates mark a powerful combination for this purpose. However, the task is methodologically challenging. Disease frequencies are subject to both regional and temporal heterogeneity. Medical treatment records often show strong internal correlation due to diagnosis-related grouping. This frequently causes excessive variance in model parameter estimation due to rank-deficiency problems. Further, generalized linear-mixed models are often estimated via approximate inference methods as their likelihood functions do not have closed forms. These problems combined lead to unacceptable uncertainty in prevalence estimates over time. We propose an l2-penalized temporal logit-mixed model to solve these issues. We derive empirical best predictors and present a parametric bootstrap to estimate their mean-squared errors. A novel penalized maximum approximate likelihood algorithm for model parameter estimation is stated. With this new methodology, the regional obesity prevalence in Germany from 2009 to 2012 is estimated. We find that the national prevalence ranges between 15 and 16%, with significant regional clustering in eastern Germany.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34079590	<TITLE>MCTS1 promotes the development of lung adenocarcinoma by regulating E2F1 expression.</TITLE>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer that results in the majority of cancer-associated mortality. Multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 (MCTS1) is an oncogene that is expressed at high levels in several types of cancer tissues. However, its exact role and pathomechanism in the development of LUAD remains unknown. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis was performed to detect MCTS1 expression. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect MCTS1 expression in LUAD tissues and normal tissues. The MTT, colony formation, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to assess the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of LUAD cells. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of MCTS1 on the progression of LUAD and the potential mechanisms underlying its effects. The results demonstrated that MCTS1 expression was upregulated in LUAD tissues and cells, which was associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with LUAD. MCTS1 knockdown inhibited LUAD progression by suppressing cell viability and motility, and promoting apoptosis. In addition, E2F1 protein expression was attenuated following MCTS1 knockdown. The silencing MCTS1-induced inhibitory effect on LUAD malignancy was reversed following overexpression of E2F1 by modulating the c-Myc signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that MCTS1 facilitates cell proliferation and migration, and suppresses apoptosis of LUAD cells by regulating E2F1 expression and the c-Myc signaling pathway.	Inhibition of MCTS1 ameliorated a lung cancer disease model
34141394	<TITLE>Assessment of adaptive behaviour in children with intellectual disability in Oman: an examination of ABAS-3 factor structure and validation in the Arab context.</TITLE>In Oman and elsewhere in Arab countries school professionals rely on measures that were developed in Western countries. Measures that assess adaptive behaviour (AB) that have been developed in Western cultures are argued to be culturally bound. Nevertheless, these measures are used elsewhere despite a paucity of data that examine their cross-national transportability. The theme of test adaptation and transportability of psychological measures is an important issue for school/educational psychologists, clinicians and educational professionals. The present study describes the adaptation process of the U.S.-developed Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System, Third Edition Teacher Form (ABAS-3-TF) for ages 5 to 14 in the Sultanate of Oman, one of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Procedures implemented to help ensure a valid translation and cultural adaptation process are described. Data on 410 children with intellectual disability are examined using the Arabic version of ABAS-3-TF, focusing on testing its factor structure and gender invariance. Data from the Arabic version of ABAS-3-TF provide evidence for the adequacy of a one general factor model. Scale reliability is high for the Arabic version. The finding of invariance across males and females indicate that the scale's factor structure is similar for the two groups. The Arabic version of ABAS-3-TF is adequate for use by clinicians, school psychologists and educational professionals in Oman.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34159003	<TITLE>Early Chest Re-Exploration for Excessive Bleeding in Post Cardiac Surgery Patients: Does It Matter?</TITLE>Introduction Re-explorations after open-heart surgery are often required if the patient is bleeding or shows features of cardiovascular instability and does not improve with conservative measures. Our study aims to determine whether timely re-exploration of patients who are bleeding has an impact on the morbidity and mortality of the patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of 75 patients that underwent open-heart surgery and subsequently underwent chest re-exploration for excessive bleeding between March 2018 and March 2020. Patients who were reopened post-op for indications other than excessive bleeding were excluded. Results A total number of cases were 700, out of which 75 (9.3%) patients were reopened, as compared to the literature, which shows worldwide 2-11% being reopened. Post-operative drain output was 1000ml to 1500ml in 47 (62.7%) and more than 1500ml in 28 (37.3%) patients before they were reopened. In 67 (89.3%) patients, three to five units of blood were transfused, and in eight (10.7%) patients, more than five units of blood were transfused. We believe our mortality in the reopened patients was low, because of timely intervention and early re-exploration, and is probably the reason why our figures land in a higher range (2-11%) of reopened cases (9.3%). Reopening time was less than five hours in 49 (65.3%) patients and less than 10 hours in 26 (34.7%) patients in our study. We tried to minimize the loss of blood and re-explored the patients before they lose excessive blood, the average time for reopening in our study was less than 10 hours. The average intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 4.2 days (range three to six days). Wound infections were reported in one of three patients. There was no mortality in these patients. Surgical site of bleeding was identified in 54 (72%) patients and no particular site was found in 21 (28%) patients. Suggesting that it is common to have a surgical bleeder than coagulopathy induced bleeding in post-cardiac surgery patients Conclusions We believe our low mortality (0%) is due to early reopening in patients who are bleeding excessively after cardiac surgery.

34164515	<TITLE>A novel, minimally invasive technique to establish the animal model of spinal cord injury.</TITLE>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic disease that is associated with high morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. The animal spinal cord contusion model is similar to clinical SCI; therefore, this model is often used to study the pathophysiological changes and treatment strategies for humans after SCI. The present study aimed to introduce a novel, minimally invasive technique to establish an SCI model, and to evaluate its advantages compared with conventional methods.|Incision length, blood loss, length of time, and model success rate during the operation were recorded. Postoperative hematuria, incision hematoma, scoliosis [detected by micro computed tomography (Micro-CT)] and mortality were analyzed to evaluate surgical complications. The visual observation of the tissue was used to compare the effect of laminectomy by 2 methods on the scar hyperplasia at the injured site. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score and catwalk automated quantitative gait analysis were conducted to measure behavioral function recovery. To evaluate the nerve function recovery of rats postoperatively, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) were studied by electrophysiological analyses.|The results of operation-related parameters of the two models (conventional surgery group vs. minimally invasive surgery group) were as follows: surgical incision length: 23.58±1.58 versus 12.67±1.50 mm (P<0.05), blood loss: 3.96±1.05 versus 1.34±0.87 mL (P<0.05), and total operative time: 12.67±1.78 versus 10.33±1.92 min (P<0.05). In addition, the success rate of the 2 models was 100%. Surgical complications (conventional surgery group vs. minimally invasive surgery group) were as follows: hematuria: 25% versus 8.3%, kyphosis: 25% versus 0%, incision hematoma: 30% versus 9%, and mortality: 25% versus 8.3%. Micro-CT indicated severe scoliosis in the conventional surgery group. Gross tissue results showed that the conventional surgery group had more severe fibrous scar hyperplasia. The results of the BBB scores, catwalk automated quantitative gait analysis, and electrophysiology showed that the difference between the two groups was statistically significant in terms of behavioral recovery and neuroelectrophysiology.|The minimally invasive technique has the advantages of small incision and reduced tissue damage and surgical complications, and may be used as an alternative spinal cord contusion method.

34172426	<TITLE>COVID-19 pandemic: Effects of national lockdown on the state of health of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Moroccan population.</TITLE>The complete lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had imposed a new behavior and lifestyle especially in terms of diet, physical activity, and the management of patients with chronic diseases.|The present study aimed to analyze the impact of lockdown on the monitoring and care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a Moroccan population from the Doukkala region.|We conducted a retrospective observational study including 121 T2DM patients recruited from the Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment Center of El Jadida city. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data of our T2DM patients were recorded before and after lockdown that lasted 82 days. All patients have signed an informed consent after being informed about the purely scientific aims of the study.|Our sample involved 84 women and 37 men with an age average of 57.31 ± 0.91 years. The effects of lockdown were more marked in women than in men: women showed a significant tendency to gain weight (from 78.13 ± 1.36 kg to 81.80 ± 1.45 kg; p-value < 0.000), that impacted the body mass index (p-value < 0.000); they also showed significant increases in HbA1c values (p-value = 0.001), significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.0302) and a surprising increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-value = 0.0132). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the women sample increased from 46.4% to 54.8% after the lockdown. In men, the negative effect of lockdown was observed only in HbA1c that values increased significantly from 8.66 ± 0.21% to 9.51 ± 0.25% (p-value = 0.0127).|Our results reveal that lockdown had impacted negatively the health status of T2DM patients, especially women. We suggest an urgent development of programs aiming to improve the hygiene of life and to reduce the impact of future crises on patients suffering chronic diseases such as T2DM.

34212221	<TITLE>Altered brain structural topological properties and its correlations with clinical characteristics in episodic migraine without aura.</TITLE>To investigate the topological alterations of the whole-brain white matter structural networks in episodic migraine (EM) without aura.|Forty-five EM patients without aura and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were registered, and underwent diffusion tensor MRI acquisition at interictal. Graph theory-based analyses were then performed for the characterization of brain structural network properties. Pearson correlation analysis was performed on each network metric between the EM patients and healthy controls.|The EM patients exhibited abnormal global network properties and local network topology that were characterized by more strongly integrated, more efficient, and faster information transferring. These network differences were widely located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal regions. Additionally, the local efficient of global parameters showed positive correlation with visual analogue scale, and along with prolonging disease duration, the nodal efficiency would be reduced, and the nodal shortest path length would be increased. Headache Impact Test version 6 scores have negative correlation with the nodal shortest path length, and positive correlations with the nodal efficiency.|The results indicate that EM patients had aberrant topological structure and make a better understanding of structural connectivity in EM; it may provide imaging evidence for clinical study of migraine pathogenesis.

34322017	<TITLE>Vascular Adhesion Protein-1 (VAP-1)/Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase (SSAO): A Potential Therapeutic Target for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases.</TITLE>Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), whose enzymatic activity regulates the adhesion/exudation of leukocytes in/from blood vessels. Due to its abundant expressions in vascular systems and prominent roles in inflammations, increasing attentions have been paid to the roles of VAP-1/SSAO in atherosclerosis, a chronic vascular inflammation that eventually drives clinical cardiovascular events. Clinical studies have demonstrated a potential value of soluble VAP-1 (sVAP-1) for the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Recent findings revealed that VAP-1 is expressed in atherosclerotic plaques and treatment with VAP-1 inhibitors alleviates the progression of atherosclerosis. This review will focus on the roles of VAP-1/SSAO in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and therapeutic potentials of VAP-1 inhibitors for cardiovascular diseases.

34361609	<TITLE>(E)-2,6,10-Trimethyldodec-8-en-2-ol: An Undescribed Sesquiterpenoid from Copaiba Oil.</TITLE>The use of copaiba oil has been reported since the 16th century in Amazon traditional medicine, especially as an anti-inflammatory ingredient and for wound healing. The use of copaiba oil continues today, and it is sold in various parts of the world, including the United States. Copaiba oil contains mainly sesquiterpenes, bioactive compounds that are popular for their positive effect on human health. As part of our ongoing research endeavors to identify the chemical constituents of broadly consumed herbal supplements or their adulterants, copaiba oil was investigated. In this regard, copaiba oil was subjected to repeated silica gel column chromatography to purify the compounds. As a result, one new and seven known sesquiterpenes/sesquiterpenoids were isolated and identified from the copaiba oil. The new compound was elucidated as (E)-2,6,10-trimethyldodec-8-en-2-ol. Structure elucidation was achieved by 1D- and 2D NMR and GC/Q-ToF mass spectral data analyses. The isolated chemical constituents in this study could be used as chemical markers to evaluate the safety or quality of copaiba oil.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34366614	<TITLE>Multifocal autoimmune pancreatitis: A retrospective study in a single tertiary center of 26 patients with a 20-year literature review.</TITLE>Multifocal-type autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), sometimes forming multiple pancreatic masses, is frequently misdiagnosed as pancreatic malignancy in routine clinical practice. It is critical to know the imaging features of multifocal-type AIP to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating the value of diffusionweighted imaging (DWI), axial fat-suppressed T1 weighted image (T1WI), and dynamic contrast enhanced-computed tomography (DCE-CT) in detecting the lesions of multifocal-type AIP.|To clarify the exact prevalence and radiological findings of multifocal AIP in our cohorts and compare the sensitivity of DWI, axial fat-suppressed T1WI, and DCE-CT for detecting AIP lesions. We also compared radiological features between multifocal AIP and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with several key imaging landmarks.|Twenty-six patients with proven multifocal AIP were retrospectively included. Two blinded independent radiologists rated their confidence level in detecting the lesions on a 5-point scale and assessed the diagnostic performance of DWI, axial fat-suppressed T1WI, and DCE-CT. CT and magnetic resonance imaging of multifocal AIP were systematically reviewed for typical imaging findings and compared with the key imaging features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.|Among 118 patients with AIP, 26 (22.0%) had multiple lesions (56 lesions). Ulcerative colitis was associated with multifocal AIP in 7.7% (2/26) of patients, and Crohn's disease was present in 15.3% (4/26) of patients. In multifocal AIP, multiple lesions, delayed homogeneous enhancement, multifocal strictures of the main pancreatic duct, capsule-like rim, lower apparent diffusion coefficient values, and elevated serum Ig4 level were observed significantly more frequently than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, whereas the presence of capsule-like rim in multifocal-type AIP was lower in frequency than total AIP. Of these lesions of multifocal AIP, DWI detected 89.3% (50/56) and 82.1% (46/56) by the senior and junior radiologist, respectively.|Multifocal AIP is not as rare as previously thought and was seen in 22.0% of our patients. The diagnostic performance of DWI for detecting multifocal AIP was best followed by axial fat-suppressed T1WI and DCE-CT.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We performed extensive sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings.|Seventeen RCTs and eight cohorts with 81508 BCa patients were identified. A significant beneficial effect of BPs on BCa survival was found (RR, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.627-0.839), and the TSA results also suggested firm evidence for this beneficial effect. Both summarized results from RCTs and cohorts provided firm evidence for this effect, although the effect estimates were stronger from cohorts than RCTs (RR, 0.892; 95% CI, 0.829-0.961; 0.570; 95% CI, 0.436-0.745; respectively). This beneficial effect was confirmed for bone-metastases (RR, 0.713; 95% CI, 0.602-0.843) and postmenopausal women (RR, 0.737; 95% CI, 0.640-0.850). Importantly, our results demonstrated that this beneficial effect was retained at least 1-2 years after treatment completion (RR, 0.780; 95% CI, 0.638-0.954) and could persist for up to more than 4 years after treatment completion (RR, 0.906; 95% CI, 0.832-0.987). Extensive sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of our results. The GRADE quality of evidence was generally judged to be moderate to high.|The present study provides firm evidence for a significant beneficial effect of BPs on BCa survival in patients with early-stage BCa, and this effect was retained at least 1-2 years after BP treatment completion.

34394071	<TITLE>Emerging Cellular Therapies for Anti-myeloperoxidase Vasculitis and Other Autoimmune Diseases.</TITLE>Anti-myeloperoxidase vasculitis (MPO-AAV) is a life-threatening autoimmune disease which causes severe inflammation of small blood vessels, mainly in the kidney. As for many other autoimmune diseases, current treatments, which consist of general immunosuppressants, are partially effective, toxic and broadly immunosuppressive, causing significant and serious adverse effects in many patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more targeted and less harmful therapies. Tolerogenic dendritic cells, regulatory T cells and stem cells have emerged as attractive, new and safer options for the treatment for various autoimmune diseases due to their unique and selective immunosuppressive capacity. In this review, we will discuss how these cellular therapies offer potential to become novel and safer treatments for MPO-AAV.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34394161	<TITLE>Oxylipins From Different Pathways Trigger Mitochondrial Stress Signaling Through Respiratory Complex III.</TITLE>Plant oxylipins are signaling molecules produced from fatty acids by oxidative pathways, mainly initiated by 9- and 13-lipoxygenases (9-LOX and 13-LOX), alpha-dioxygenases or non-enzymatic oxidation. Oxylipins from the 9-LOX pathway induce oxidative stress and control root development and plant defense. These activities have been associated with mitochondrial processes, but precise cellular targets and pathways remain unknown. In order to study oxylipin signaling, we previously generated a collection of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that were insensitive to the 9-LOX products 9(S)-hydroxy-10,12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid (9-HOT) and its ketone derivative 9-KOT (noxy mutants). Here, we describe noxy1, noxy3, noxy5, noxy23, and noxy54 mutants, all affected in nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins, and use them to study the role of mitochondria in oxylipin signaling. Functional and phenotypic analyses showed that noxy plants displayed mitochondrial aggregation, reduced respiration rates and resistance to the complex III inhibitor Antimycin A (AA), thus indicating a close similarity of the oxylipin signaling and mitochondrial stress. Application of 9-HOT and 9-KOT protected plants against subsequent mitochondrial stress, whereas they boosted root growth reduction when applied in combination with complex III inhibitors but did not with inhibitors of other respiratory complexes. A similar effect was caused by linear-chain oxylipins from 13-LOX or non-enzymatic pathways having α,β-unsaturated hydroxyl or keto groups in their structure. Studies to investigate 9-HOT and 9-KOT activity indicated that they do not reduce respiration rates, but their action is primarily associated with enhanced ROS responses. This was supported by the results showing that 9-HOT or 9-KOT combined with AA amplified the expression of oxylipin- and ROS-responding genes but not of the AA marker AOX1a, thus implying the activation of a specific mitochondria retrograde signaling pathway. Our results implicate mitochondrial complex III as a hub in the signaling activity of multiple oxylipin pathways and point at downstream ROS responses as components of oxylipin function.

34404018	<TITLE>Pulsed blue light inactivates two strains of human coronavirus.</TITLE>Emerging evidence suggests that blue light has the potential to inactivate viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effect of 405 nm, 410 nm, 425 nm and 450 nm pulsed blue light (PBL) on human alpha coronavirus HCoV-229 E and human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43, using Qubit fluorometry and RT-LAMP to quantitate the amount of nucleic acid in irradiated and control samples. Like SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are single stranded RNA viruses transmitted by air and direct contact; they have similar genomic sizes as SARS-CoV-2, and are used as surrogates for SARS-CoV-2. Irradiation was carried out either at 32.4 J cm-2 using 3 mW cm-2 irradiance or at 130 J cm-2 using 12 mW cm-2 irradiance. Results: (1) At each wavelength tested, PBL was antiviral against both coronaviruses. (2) 405 nm light gave the best result, yielding 52.3% (2.37 log10) inactivation against HCoV-OC43 (p < .0001), and a significant 1.46 log 10 (44%) inactivation of HCoV-229E (p < .01). HCoV-OC43, which like SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, was more susceptible to PBL irradiation than alpha coronavirus HCoV-229E. The latter finding suggests that PBL is potentially antiviral against multiple coronavirus strains, and that, while its potency may vary from one virus to another, it seems more antiviral against beta coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43. (3) Further, the antiviral effect of PBL was better at a higher irradiance than a lower irradiance, and this indicates that with further refinement, a protocol capable of yielding 100% inactivation of viruses is attainable.

34411311	<TITLE>Epidemiologic characteristics of cases with reinfection, recurrence, and hospital readmission due to COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</TITLE>Recent studies reported that some recovered COVID-19 patients have tested positive for virus nucleic acid again. A systematic search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to March 6, 2021. The pooled estimation of reinfection, recurrence, and hospital readmission among recovered COVID-19 patients was 3, 133, and 75 per 1000 patients, respectively. The overall estimation of reinfection among males compared to females was greater. The prevalence of recurrence in females compared to males was more common. Also, hospital readmission between sex groups was the same. There is uncertainty about long-term immunity after SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, the possibility of reinfection and recurrence after recovery is not unexpected. In addition, there is a probability of hospital readmission due to adverse events of COVID-19 after discharge. However, with mass vaccination of people and using the principles of prevention and appropriate management of the disease, frequent occurrence of the disease can be controlled.

34451291	<TITLE>Strain Rate Sensitivity of Polycarbonate and Thermoplastic Polyurethane for Various 3D Printing Temperatures and Layer Heights.</TITLE>In this work, strain rate sensitivity was studied for 3D-printed polycarbonate (PC) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials. Specimens were fabricated through fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing (AM) technology and were tested at various strain rates. The effects of two FFF process parameters, i.e., nozzle temperature and layer thickness, were also investigated. A wide analysis for the tensile strength (MPa), the tensile modulus of elasticity (MPa), the toughness (MJ/m3) and the strain rate sensitivity index 'm' was conducted. Additionally, a morphological analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the side and the fracture area of the specimens. Results from the different strain rates for each material were analyzed, in conjunction with the two FFF parameters tested, to determine their effect on the mechanical response of the two materials. PC and TPU materials exhibited similarities regarding their temperature response at different strain rates, while differences in layer height emerged regarding the appropriate choice for the FFF process. Overall, strain rate had a significant effect on the mechanical response of both materials.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
34468314	<TITLE>In situ imaging of bacterial outer membrane projections and associated protein complexes using electron cryo-tomography.</TITLE>The ability to produce outer membrane projections in the form of tubular membrane extensions (MEs) and membrane vesicles (MVs) is a widespread phenomenon among diderm bacteria. Despite this, our knowledge of the ultrastructure of these extensions and their associated protein complexes remains limited. Here, we surveyed the ultrastructure and formation of MEs and MVs, and their associated protein complexes, in tens of thousands of electron cryo-tomograms of ~90 bacterial species that we have collected for various projects over the past 15 years (Jensen lab database), in addition to data generated in the Briegel lab. We identified outer MEs and MVs in 13 diderm bacterial species and classified several major ultrastructures: (1) tubes with a uniform diameter (with or without an internal scaffold), (2) tubes with irregular diameter, (3) tubes with a vesicular dilation at their tip, (4) pearling tubes, (5) connected chains of vesicles (with or without neck-like connectors), (6) budding vesicles and nanopods. We also identified several protein complexes associated with these MEs and MVs which were distributed either randomly or exclusively at the tip. These complexes include a secretin-like structure and a novel crown-shaped structure observed primarily in vesicles from lysed cells. In total, this work helps to characterize the diversity of bacterial membrane projections and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Actual metastatic involvement often develops in the urinary bladder, while the upper urinary tract is infrequently affected. In addition, the lungs, breast, and prostate gland are the usual primary sites. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) may spread to the ureter directly or seeds via vascular or lymphatic channels. It may pose struggles in the differential diagnosis because CRC shares standard pathologic features with the primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary tract.|We describe the case of an 81-year-old man who was referred to our hospital with a distal ureteral tumor that was treated by a ureteronephrectomy.

34557494	<TITLE>Multiomics Analysis of Neuroblastoma Cells Reveals a Diversity of Malignant Transformations.</TITLE>Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric cancer of the developing sympathetic nervous system that exhibits significant variation in the stage of differentiation and cell composition of tumors. Global loss of DNA methylation and genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we used our recently developed single-base resolution approaches, hmTOP-seq and uTOP-seq, for construction of 5hmC maps and identification of large partially methylated domains (PMDs) in different NB cell subpopulations. The 5hmC profiles revealed distinct signatures characteristic to different cell lineages and stages of malignant transformation of NB cells in a conventional and oxygen-depleted environment, which often occurs in tumors. The analysis of the cell-type-specific PMD distribution highlighted differences in global genome organization among NB cells that were ascribed to the same lineage identity by transcriptomic networks. Collectively, we demonstrated a high informativeness of the integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic research and large-scale genome structure in investigating the mechanisms that regulate cell identities and developmental stages of NB cells. Such multiomics analysis, as compared with mutational studies, open new ways for identification of novel disease-associated features which bring prognostic and therapeutic value in treating this aggressive pediatric disease.

34599320	<TITLE>Fatigue in inflammatory rheumatic diseases: current knowledge and areas for future research.</TITLE>Fatigue is a complex phenomenon and an important health concern for many people with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, primary Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although some clinical trials have shown the benefits of cognitive behavioural therapy in fatigue management, the effect of this approach is relatively modest, and no curative treatment has been identified. The pathogenesis of fatigue remains unclear. Despite many challenges and limitations, a growing body of research points to roles for the immune system, the central and autonomic nervous systems and the neuroendocrine system in the induction and maintenance of fatigue in chronic diseases. New insights indicate that sleep, genetic susceptibility, metabolic disturbances and other biological and physiological mechanisms contribute to fatigue. Furthermore, understanding of the relationships between psychosocial factors and fatigue is increasing. However, the interrelationships between these diverse mechanisms and fatigue remain poorly defined. In this Review, we outline various biological, physiological and psychosocial determinants of fatigue in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and propose mechanistic and conceptual models of fatigue to summarize current understanding, stimulate debate and develop further research ideas.

34630759	<TITLE>The use of IT systems in financial and accounting services for enterprises in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.</TITLE>In Poland, remote teams and work outside of the company were rare by this time. Almost all organizations had to virtualize at a faster rate by delegating their employees to work remotely, facing many challenges that they had to overcome in a short time. This article aims to check the directions and effects of changes in the digitalization of financial-accounting processes concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of use financial-accounting programs in remote work and upgrade of work organization, availability to internet platforms, identification security level of data, defining barriers that influence the limit of digitalization processes and financial-accounting programs were made.

34710388	<TITLE>An Epidermal-Specific Role for Arginase1 during Cutaneous Wound Repair.</TITLE>Nonhealing wounds are a major area of unmet clinical need remaining problematic to treat. Improved understanding of prohealing mechanisms is invaluable. The enzyme arginase1 (ARG1) is involved in prohealing responses, with its role in macrophages best characterized. ARG1 is also expressed by keratinocytes; however, ARG1 function in these critical wound repair cells is not understood. We characterized ARG1 expression in keratinocytes during normal cutaneous repair and reveal de novo temporal and spatial expression at the epidermal wound edge. Interestingly, epidermal ARG1 expression was decreased in both human and murine delayed healing wounds. We therefore generated a keratinocyte-specific ARG1-null mouse model (K14-cre;Arg1fl/fl) to explore arginase function. Wound repair, linked to changes in keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and differentiation, was significantly delayed in K14-cre;Arg1fl/fl mice. Similarly, using the arginase inhibitor N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, human in vitro and ex vivo models further confirmed this finding, revealing the importance of the downstream polyamine pathway in repair. Indeed, restoring the balance in ARG1 activity through the addition of putrescine proved beneficial in wound closure. In summary, we show that epidermal ARG1 plays, to our knowledge, a previously unreported intrinsic role in cutaneous healing, highlighting epidermal ARG1 and the downstream mediators as potential targets for the therapeutic modulation of wound repair.

34760792	<TITLE>Common Risk Factor Approach to Limit Noncommunicable Diseases and Periodontal Disease-The Molecular and Cellular Basis: A Narrative Review.</TITLE>The link between periodontal disease and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has been the subject of major research over the past several years. The primary objective of this review is to understand the cellular and molecular components that link common risk factors (exposure) in adult patients (population) with periodontal disease and other NCDs (outcome). The secondary objective is to interpret from existing literature the possibility of identifying the molecular plausibility of the Common Risk Factor Approach (CRFA).|A literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for all published articles pertaining to the molecular and cellular basis of the risk factors between periodontal diseases and major NCDs. Data from all randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control, cohort studies, literature, and systematic reviews were included.|Periodontal pathogens, stress, obesity, smoking, and dietary factors are some of the common risk factors between periodontal disease and NCDs.|Understanding the molecular and cellular link of common risk factors between NCDs and periodontal disease would ensure the application of CRFA. The CRFA implies that controlling the risk factors associated with NCDs can have an incredible positive impact on regulating many chronic conditions, which would extend to periodontal health also.

34901093	<TITLE>In vitro Activity of Allicin Alone and in Combination With Antifungal Drugs Against Microsporum canis Isolated From Patients With Tinea Capitis.</TITLE>The checkerboard broth method based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M38-A3 document was used in this study to evaluate the in vitro activity of allicin alone and in combination with the antifungal drugs (griseofulvin, fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine) against Microsporum canis isolated from patients with tinea capitis. When allicin was used alone, only weak anti-M. canis effects were found. The MIC50, MIC90 and geometric mean (GM) of terbinafine were the lowest among the compounds tested. Synergism was observed for the combinations of allicin with itraconazole and terbinafine. Only indifference was observed for the combinations of allicin with griseofulvin and fluconazole. Our study illustrated the synergism of allicin in combination with itraconazole and terbinafine, which could be a reference for the treatment of tinea capitis due to M. canis.

The main objective was to develop an implantable, programmable, and wireless device for electrical stimulation of DRG and a methodology that can be used in translational research, especially to understand the mechanism of neuromodulation and to test new treatment modalities in animal models of pain.|We developed and tested a stimulator that uses a battery-powered microelectronic circuit, to generate constant current square biphasic or monophasic pulsed waveform of variable amplitudes and duration. It is controlled by software and an external controller that allows radio frequency communication with the stimulator. The stimulator was implanted in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The lead was positioned at the L5 DRG level, while the stimulator was placed in the skin pocket at the ipsilateral side. Forty-five animals were used and divided into six groups: spinal nerve ligation (SNL), chronic compression injury of the DRG (CCD), SNL + active DRG stimulation, intact control group, group with the implanted sham stimulator, and sham lead. Behavioral testing was performed on the day preceding surgery and three times postoperatively (1st, 3rd, and 7th day).|In animals with SNL, neurostimulation reduced pain-related behavior, tested with pinprick hyperalgesia, pinprick withdrawal test, and cold test, while the leads per se did not cause DRG compression. The rats well tolerated the stimulator. It did not hinder animal movement, and it enabled the animals to be housed under regular conditions.|A proof-of-concept experiment with our stimulator verified the usability of the device. The stimulator enables a wide range of research applications from adjusting stimulation parameters for different pain conditions, studying new stimulation methods with different frequencies and waveforms to obtain knowledge about analgesic mechanisms of DRG stimulation.

35007420	<TITLE>Land Use Overrides Stream Order and Season in Driving Dissolved Organic Matter Dynamics Throughout the Year in a River Network.</TITLE>Anthropogenic land use has increased nutrient concentrations and altered dissolved organic matter (DOM) character and its bioavailability. Despite widespread recognition that DOM character and its reactivity can vary temporally, the relative influence of land use and stream order on DOM characteristics is poorly understood across seasons and the entire flow regime. We examined DOM character and 28-day bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) across a river network to determine the relative roles of land use and stream order in driving variability in DOM character and bioavailability throughout the year. DOM in 1st-order streams was distinct from higher stream orders with lower DOC concentrations, less aromatic (specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254)), more autochthonous (fluorescence index), and more recently produced (β/α) DOM. Across all months, variability in DOM character was primarily explained by land use, rather than stream order or season. Land use and stream order explained the most DOM variation in transitional and winter months and the least during dry months. BDOC was greater in watersheds with less aromatic (SUVA254) and more recent allochthonous DOM (β/α) and more development and impervious surface. With continued development, the bioavailability of DOM in the smallest and most impacted watersheds is expected to increase.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Bangladesh witnessed one of the largest outbreaks in 2017. Here, we described the clinical profile of the chikungunya outbreak in Bangladesh and its heterogeneity across three hotspots.|This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 432 individuals interviewed from the outpatient department of three study sites (Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sitakundu Upazilla of Bangladesh) after confirmation by the study physicians. Both laboratory-confirmed cases and probable cases were recruited between July and October 2017.|Of all, 18% (79) were laboratory confirmed, and 353 82% (335) were probable cases. The male:female ratio was almost equal (1.09:1), and the predominant age group was 18-59 years. The mean age of the presentation was 36.07 ± 13.62 (SD) years. Fever and arthralgia were the most common presentations and were present in > 95% of cases. Other frequent symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Approximately half of the patients had arthritis and erythematous rash. Arthritis was predominant in Chittagong city, while maculopapular rash was not observed in Sitakunda city. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are more common among patients in Dhaka city. Significant heterogeneity of clinical manifestations was present across the three hotspots (p < 0.05 for all). Both confirmed and probable cases shared similar characteristics except muscle ache (p = 0.22) and rash (p = 0.37).|The clinical profile of chikungunya virus-induced disease displays significant location-related heterogeneity in Bangladesh during a large outbreak. Although the causes of such differences are unclear, improved public and medical personnel education on this condition may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.

35107372	<TITLE>Host Cellular RNA Helicases Regulate SARS-CoV-2 Infection.</TITLE>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the largest RNA genome, approximately 30 kb, among RNA viruses. The DDX DEAD box RNA helicase is a multifunctional protein involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Therefore, host RNA helicases may regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome. In this study, I investigated the potential role of several host cellular RNA helicases in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, DDX21 knockdown markedly accumulated intracellular viral RNA and viral production, as well as viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that DDX21 strongly restricts the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, MOV10 RNA helicase also suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 RNA helicases were required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection dispersed the P-body formation of DDX6 and MOV10 RNA helicases as well as XRN1 exonuclease, while the viral infection did not induce stress granule formation. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein interacted with DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX6, DDX21, and MOV10 and disrupted the P-body formation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N hijacks DDX6 to carry out viral replication. Conversely, DDX21 and MOV10 restricted SARS-CoV-2 infection through an interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N with host cellular RNA helicases. Altogether, host cellular RNA helicases seem to regulate the SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has a large RNA genome, of approximately 30 kb. To regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome, host RNA helicases may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this study, I have demonstrated that DDX21 and MOV10 RNA helicases limit viral infection and replication. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 are required for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupted P-body formation and attenuated or suppressed stress granule formation. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 seems to hijack host cellular RNA helicases to play a proviral role by facilitating viral infection and replication and by suppressing the host innate immune system.

35140885	<TITLE>Effective use of sequence information to predict CRISPR-Cas9 off-target.</TITLE>The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system is the third-generation gene-editing technology that has been widely used in biomedical applications. However, off-target effects occurring CRISPR/Cas9 system has been a challenging problem it faces in practical applications. Although many predictive models have been developed to predict off-target activities, current models do not effectively use sequence pair information. There is still room for improved accuracy. This study aims to effectively use sequence pair information to improve the model's performance for predicting off-target activities. We propose a new coding scheme for coding sequence pairs and design a new model called CRISPR-IP for predicting off-target activity. Our coding scheme distinguishes regions with different functions in the sequence pairs through the function channel. Moreover, it distinguishes between bases and base pairs using type channels, effectively representing the sequence pair information. The CRISPR-IP model is based on CNN, BiLSTM, and the attention layer to learn features of sequence pairs. We performed performance verification on two data sets and found that our coding scheme can represent sequence pair information effectively, and the CRISPR-IP model performance is better than others. Data and source codes are available at https://github.com/BioinfoVirgo/CRISPR-IP.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Then, the function of circRHOBTB3 in CRC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq and RNA pull-down assays together with mass spectrometry identified the downstream signals and the binding proteins of circRHOBTB3. Finally, Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were designed to target circularization and secretion elements of circRHOBTB3 for CRC therapy.|circRHOBTB3 levels were increased in the sera but was downregulated in tissue samples in CRC, and the downregulation was associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, circRHOBTB3 acts a tumor-suppressive circRNA by repressing metabolic pathways, intracellular ROS production in CRC. Several key elements were discovered to regulate circRHOBTB3 circularization and exosomal secretion. Moreover, SNF8 was identified that sorts circRHOBTB3 into exosomes. Interestingly, we found that CRC cells could actively secrete more circRHOBTB3 than normal cells. According to the sequence of regulatory elements for circularization and exosomal secretion, we designed and synthesized ASOs, which increased circRHOBTB3 expression and blocked circRHOBTB3 exosomal secretion. More importantly, ASOs could inhibit CRC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.|circRHOBTB3 plays a tumor-suppressive role in CRC and has to be excreted out of cells to sustain cancer cell fitness. ASOs targeting regulatory elements for circularization and exosomal secretion will become a novel antitumor strategy.	Inhibition of circRHOBTB3 ameliorated a colorectal cancer disease model
35149554	<TITLE>Superposition strategies: How and why White people say contradictory things about race.</TITLE>Due to the centrality of race and racism in social, economic, and political life, coupled with the racially privileged position of White people, the assessment of White racial attitudes is an ongoing concern. There is a great deal of survey-based, quantitative work that demonstrates a compelling case of White attitudinal polarization-a grouping of authoritarian, racist attitudes versus another alliance of progressive, antiracist attitudes-an increasingly racialized culture war. However, other studies, largely qualitative and open-ended, demonstrate the heterogeneous, shifting, and hypocritical nature of White discourse about race. To resolve this paradox, I refrain from the assumption that White racial "attitudes" are essentially bifurcated, while I also refuse the contention that White people produce spontaneous narratives whole-cloth. Rather, I argue that with sustained attention to time, context, and triangulation, we can better understand how and why White people speak of People of Color in positive ways one moment and negative the next, marshaling both to defend, rationalize, or improve their racialized subject position. I argue that these contradictions are-à la Schrödinger's famous thought experiment-"superposition strategies." Both racist and antiracist attitudes are simultaneously alive and dead in the same individual or group. Contradictory White discourse helps maintain a sense of self-efficacy and coherent White racial identity within conflictual and politically supercharged social situations, as well as within racially unequal social structures.

35204086	<TITLE>NRF2 Protects against Altered Pulmonary T Cell Differentiation in Neonates Following In Utero Ultrafine Particulate Matter Exposure.</TITLE>Early life exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution negatively impacts neonatal health. The underlying mechanisms following prenatal exposure, particularly to ultrafine particles (UFP, diameter ≤ 0.1 μm), are not fully understood; To evaluate the role of Nrf2 in response to in utero UFP exposure, we exposed time-mated Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) or wildtype (WT) mice to filtered air (FA) or 100 μg/m3 ultrafine PM daily throughout pregnancy. Offspring were evaluated for pulmonary immunophenotypes and pulmonary/systemic oxidative stress on postnatal day 5, a timepoint at which we previously demonstrated viral respiratory infection susceptibility; Nrf2-/- offspring exposed to FA had significantly lower average body weights compared to FA-exposed WT pups. Moreover, PM-exposed Nrf2-/- offspring weighed significantly less than PM-exposed WT pups. Notably, PM-exposed Nrf2-/- offspring showed a decreased pulmonary Th1/Th2 ratio, indicating a Th2 bias. Th17 cells were increased in FA-exposed Nrf2-/- neonates yet decreased in PM-exposed Nrf2-/- neonates. Analysis of oxidative stress-related genes in lung and oxidative stress biomarkers in liver tissues did not vary significantly across exposure groups or genotypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that the lack of Nrf2 causes growth inhibitory effects in general and in response to gestational UFP exposure. Prenatal UFP exposure skews CD4+ T lymphocyte differentiation toward Th2 in neonates lacking Nrf2, signifying its importance in maternal exposure and infant immune responses.

35303628	<TITLE>A 60 MeV proton beam-line dedicated to research and development programs.</TITLE>A new proton beam-line dedicated to R&D programs has been developed at CentreAntoine Lacassagne (CAL), in Nice (France), in collaboration with the Centrenational d'études spatiales (CNES). This is the second beam-line of the MEDICYC 65 MeV cyclotron that is currently in operation, the first being the clinical 'eye-line' used for ocular proton therapy. The R&D beam-line is proposed with two configurations, the first producing a Gaussian narrow beam of a few mm width, the second a 100 mm diameter flat beam with a homogeneity better than ±3%. The energy range is (20 - ∼60) MeV, where the exact upper limit depends on the beam configuration being used. The energy spread of the non-degraded beam is (0.3 ± 0.1) MeV. A beam current between 10 pA and 10 μA can be produced with a stability better than 0.2% above 100 pA, and 2% below. The beam can be monitored online at a precision better than 5% in the flux range 1E5 (1E6) - 1E9 (1E10) p/cm2/s for a flat (Gaussian) configuration, although work is in progress to extend this range. Targeted applications for the R&D beam-line are instrumentation research, radiation tolerance tests of components and radiobiology.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Of 14,163 Australian male commercial pilots licensed in 2011, 1286 aged ≥60 had biennial eye examinations showing a cataract prevalence of 11.6%. Among 12,877 pilots aged <60, based on compulsory eye examinations only when first licensed, prevalence was 0.5%. There was no significant difference by ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels in state of residence though lowest prevalence was seen in the low-UV state of Victoria. Most cataract in pilots ≥60 years was bilateral and of mild severity, while cataract in pilots <60 were more likely to be unilateral and of greater severity.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35365589	<TITLE>Sleep Dysfunction in Adolescents With Prolonged Postconcussion Symptoms: A Reciprocal Coupling of Traumatic Brain Injury and Sleep-Related Problems.</TITLE>Concussions are often neglected injuries that affect children and adolescents. Two physiological responses to a concussion are an ionic flux and an increased indiscriminate release of glutamate, which leads to an increase of intracellular calcium and extracellular potassium. This can ultimately result in sleep dysfunction, which often occurs after concussion and has long been thought of as simply another concussion symptom.|Does the likelihood of prolonged postconcussion symptoms increase with reported sleep-related problems (SRPs) in young athletes (8-18 y) compared to concussed young athletes without SRPs and healthy controls?|Four cohort studies with level 2/3 evidence measured subjective and objective sleep dysregulations in concussed and healthy populations. Overall, there was a difference in subjective SRPs between concussed and healthy patients. This correlated with other studies where worse sleep scores during the acute phase of concussion and increased SRPs led to worse ImPACT scores in patients 3 to 12 months postconcussion and longer overall recovery. Objective sleep dysfunction measures were significantly worse in concussed patients than in healthy controls, but no significant difference existed in melatonin measures.|There is strong evidence that sleep dysfunction is both a symptom of concussion as well as a causal factor of prolonged postconcussion symptoms. These studies show that sleep dysregulation is not always evident in objective measurements, leading to the strong possibility of a functional dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle that is evident solely from subjective reports.|While there are strong cohort studies researching the role of sleep in those with postconcussion symptoms, the nature of sleep studies prevents the production of strong, high-level evidence studies such as randomized control trials. Thus, there is level B evidence that the likelihood of prolonged postconcussion symptoms is increased by a higher amount of SRPs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

We herein describe two cases of 4-chloro-1-nitrobenzene poisoning after skin exposure and detail relevant clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes.|A 45-year-old man and his 32-year-old male co-worker presented at our department shortly after skin exposure to 4-chloro-1-nitrobenzene. They developed similar symptoms, including dizziness, dyspnoea, excessive fatigue, and coma. Patients' chest inspection yielded normal findings. Despite maximal oxygen supplementation, neither patient exhibited improvements in the following clinical parameters: diffuse cyanosis, chocolate-coloured blood, and decreased pulse oximetry. For patients 1 and 2, methaemoglobin levels at admission were 78.6% and 63.6%, and 4-chloro-1-nitrobenzene concentrations were 4.12 μg/mL and 2.89 μg/mL, respectively. Their symptoms and methaemoglobin levels improved after we cautiously administered methylene blue; we subsequently detected oxidative haemolysis (confirmed by peripheral blood smears) that later resolved without further aggravation. No further episodes of anaemia were documented via telephone follow-up for eight months after hospital discharge for either patient.|Typical features of methaemoglobinaemia included diffuse cyanosis, dark chocolate-coloured blood, elevated partial pressure of oxygen, and decreased pulse oximetry saturation. Haemolysis likely occurred secondary to the toxic effects of 4-chloro-1-nitrobenzene.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Participants were new NFP nurses, most working in Colorado. Pre-(n = 42) and post-program (n = 26) surveys were completed using the Individual Workplace Perception Scale (IWPS) and endorsement of program objectives; key informant interviews were done with the initial cohort. Descriptive statistics and unpaired t-tests (for the IWPS) were used to explain program effectiveness and efficacy.|Forty-two NFP nurses participated in the program at the onset. There was consistent attendance (92% or more) among those who finished and modest individual attrition during the length of the program. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the content and meeting program objectives; there were no significant differences on pre- and post-program IWPS scores.|The program was well-received by program participants and has the potential to contribute to the professional development of new NFP nurses.

A region 1,161 base pairs upstream of the Let-7b coding region was significantly differentially methylated in ectopic samples compared with eutopic endometrium from patients with endometriosis. Four specific CpG islands within this region 2 were further analyzed individually, and 1 was found to be significantly methylated in endometriosis. We identified that transcription factor SP1 was predicted to bind to a sequence that contained this specific methylated CpG in endometriosis.|We identified differential Let-7b methylation in endometriosis, demonstrating that the epigenetic nature of the disease extends to the regulation of miRNAs. Methylation of this novel Let-7b regulatory region explains the decreased levels of this miRNA in endometriosis and is distinct from the regions implicated in regulating Let-7b in cancer. Understanding of the disease-specific mechanisms leading to diminished expression may allow for better understanding of the etiology of endometriosis as well as development of new treatment options.

35588563	<TITLE>Molecular oxygen levels regulate Sinorhizobium meliloti cell division through a FixJ-dependent transcription control mechanism.</TITLE>Rhizobia infect the roots of host legumes and induce formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules, where nitrogenase genes are inducibly expressed by micro-aerobic signals. FixL/FixJ is an oxygen signal sensing system that is unique to rhizobia. FixL monitors molecular oxygen levels and phosphorylates the response regulator FixJ, thereby regulating downstream gene expression. The cell division of rhizobia is regulated by a phosphorylation relaying cascade that includes the transcription factors CtrA, GcrA, and DnaA. In Sinorhizobium meliloti the expression of these proteins is regulated by NtrX, which affects cell division. In the present work, by analyzing the cell division phenotypes and gene expression patterns of S. meliloti fixJ and ntrX mutants, we found that S. meliloti cell division is regulated by oxygen gas levels. Under normal conditions, FixJ induced NtrX and DnaA expression, but repressed CtrA and GcrA expression. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, phosphorylated FixJ specifically bound to gene promoter regions to directly induce CtrA and GcrA expression, but to repress DnaA expression. Our findings reveal that molecular oxygen levels regulate S. meliloti cell division by a FixJ-dependent transcription control mechanism.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35633775	<TITLE>Forecasting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya using SEIR and ARIMA models.</TITLE>COVID-19, a coronavirus disease 2019, is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in Kenya was identified on March 13, 2020, with the pandemic increasing to about 237,000 confirmed cases and 4,746 deaths by August 2021. We developed an SEIR model forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya using an Autoregressive Integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model. The average time difference between the peaks of wave 1 to wave 4 was observed to be about 130 days. The 4th wave was observed to have had the least number of daily cases at the peak. According to the forecasts made for the next 60 days, the pandemic is expected to continue for a while. The 4th wave peaked on August 26, 2021 (498th day). By October 26, 2021 (60th day), the average number of daily infections will be 454 new cases and 40 severe cases, which would require hospitalization, and 16 critically ill cases requiring intensive care unit services. The findings of this study are key in developing informed mitigation strategies to ensure that the pandemic is contained and inform the preparedness of policymakers and health care workers.

35652981	<TITLE>Adolescent affective psychopathic traits: the long-term outcomes of mother-infant attachment across 14 years.</TITLE>Affective psychopathic traits have been associated with increased violence and aggression. The scholarly interest in the pathways leading to affective psychopathic traits in adolescence has been growing. Infant attachment security may be one of the early life factors that contribute to the development of affective psychopathic traits. In this study, we test the infant attachment styles measured with the Strange Situation Procedure as a predictor of adolescent affective psychopathic traits measured in three dimensions: remorselessness, unemotionality, and callousness, among 1149 families in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Propensity scores for the four attachment styles were estimated with iterative tree-based regression models. After accounting for the potential confounding effects of demographic characteristics and child temperament with the inverse probability of treatment weighting, weighted generalized linear models revealed the association between insecure/avoidant attachment style measured one year after childbirth and higher levels of remorselessness, unemotionality, and callousness at 15 years. These findings provide insights into the long-term outcomes for attachment relationships established in early life.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35654814	<TITLE>HER2 G776S mutation promotes oncogenic potential in colorectal cancer cells when accompanied by loss of APC function.</TITLE>Clinical cancer genome sequencing detects oncogenic variants that are potential targets for cancer treatment, but it also detects variants of unknown significance. These variants may interact with each other to influence tumor pathophysiology, however, such interactions have not been fully elucidated. Additionally, the effect of target therapy for those variants also unclarified. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of a HER2 mutation (G776S mutation) of unknown pathological significance, which was detected together with APC mutation by cancer genome sequencing of samples from a colorectal cancer (CRC) patient. Transfection of the HER2 G776S mutation alone slightly increased the kinase activity and phosphorylation of HER2 protein, but did not activate HER2 downstream signaling or alter the cell phenotype. On the other hand, the HER2 G776S mutation was shown to have strong oncogenic potential when loss of APC function was accompanied. We revealed that loss of APC function increased Wnt pathway activity but also increased RAS-GTP, which increased ERK phosphorylation triggered by HER2 G776S transfection. In addition, afatinib, a pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppressed tumor growth in xenografts derived from HER2 G776S-transfected CRC cells. These findings suggest that this HER2 mutation in CRC may be a potential therapeutic target.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 questionnaires were used for the assessment of quality of life. Sociodemographic characteristics and the quality of life of both patients and caregivers were studied. There were 176 patients approached and 7 patients declined to participate in the study, giving the response rate of 95.9%. A total of 169 patients were recruited and consented to this study. Whereas, for SF-36, five domains that were physical functioning, role limitation due to physical health, energy, pain, and general health were statistically significant between both groups (p < 0.05). Factors that favoured a high quality of life in patients were an early stage of cancer and the absence of comorbidities. While for caregivers, being single or educated was associated with a better quality of life. In our study, we found that the quality of life of gynaeoncology patients was lower than their caregivers based on EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 questionnaires.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35707029	<TITLE>Temperature prediction based on a space-time regression-kriging model.</TITLE>Many phenomena exist in the space-time domain, often with a low data sampling rate and sparsely distributed network of observed points. Therefore, spatio-temporal interpolation with high accuracy is necessary. In this paper, a space-time regression-kriging model was introduced and applied to monthly average temperature data. First, a time series decomposition was applied for each station, and a multiple linear regression model was used to fit space-time trends. Second, a valid nonseparable spatio-temporal variogram function was utilized to describe similarities of the residuals in space-time. Finally, space-time kriging was applied to predict monthly air temperature. Jackknife techniques were used to predict the monthly temperature at all stations, with correlation coefficients between predictions and observed data very close to 1. Moreover, to evaluate the advantages of space-time kriging, pure time forecasting also was executed employing an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results of these two methods show that both mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of space-time prediction are much lower than those of the pure time forecasting. The estimated temperature curves for stations also show that the former present a conspicuous improvement in interpolation accuracy when compared with the latter.

35724672	<TITLE>Evaluation of Biological Activity of a Diazocine Derivative against Heart Failure Using an Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Model.</TITLE>There are studies, which suggest that some diazocine derivatives can exert effects on the cardiovascular system; however, these effects are not very clear.|The aim of this research was to evaluate the biological activity of a diazocine derivative against heart failure translated as area infarct.|Biological activity produced by diazocine derivatives against heart failure was determinate using an ischemia/reperfusion injury model. Besides, to characterize the molecular mechanism of effect exerted by diazocine derivative on left ventricular pressure (LVP) was determinate in an isolated rat heart model using nifedipine, PINAME TXA2, and quinalizarin as controls.|The results showed that diazocine derivative decrease the infarct area and increase the LVP. However, the effect produced by diazocine derivative on LVP was inhibited in the presence of quinalizarin.|The results indicate that biological activity produced by diazocine derivative on left ventricular pressure is through protein CK2 activation; this phenomenon could be translated as a decrease in both infarct area and heart failure.

35734614	<TITLE>Comparison between recent sphincter-sparing procedures for complex anal fistulas-ligation of intersphincteric tract vs transanal opening of intersphincteric space.</TITLE>Complex anal fistulas are difficult to treat. The main reasons for this are a higher recurrence rate and the risk of disrupting the continence mechanism because of sphincter involvement. Due to this, several sphincter-sparing procedures have been developed in the last two decades. Though moderately successful in simple fistulas (50%-75% healing rate), the healing rates in complex fistulas for most of these procedures has been dismal. Only two procedures, ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract and transanal opening of intersphincteric space have been shown to have good success rates in complex fistulas (60%-95%). Both of these procedures preserve continence while achieving high success rates. In this opinion review, I shall outline the history, compare the pros and cons, indications and contraindications and future application of both these procedures for the management of complex anal fistulas.

35758431	<TITLE>Oculofacial Prosthetic Rehabilitation Complemented With Temporary Fillers and Neurotoxin.</TITLE>Surgical treatment of head and neck cancer causes severe tissue loss, therefore, deformities and psychosocial consequences. In cases involving orbit exenteration, satisfactory reconstruction can only be achieved with prosthetic replacement, despite successful reconstructive plastic surgery. Extraoral implants, 3D scanning, and prototyping technologies have contributed to increase satisfactory aesthetic results of oculofacial prosthesis. However, to achieve prosthetic rehabilitation refinement, patients' biological tissues have been treated with injectable cosmetic adjuncts methods as complements to results. This study aimed to describe the use of botulinum toxin type A, hyaluronic acid, and calcium hydroxyapatite previously to oculofacial prostheses manufacturing, in 5 oncologic patients of a rehabilitation unit. Outcomes produced by additional cosmetic methods on tissues, prostheses planning, and overall facial rehabilitation were observed and registered by photographs. Botulinum toxin type A, hyaluronic acid, and calcium hydroxyapatite has shown to be useful in improving asymmetries, volumizing surgical depressions and dissembling atrophic scars. Presenting an additional resource to improve overall results, enabling the manufacturing of smaller, thinner, and better-fitting oculofacial prostheses. Limitations as chronic infection and necrosis episodes, related to filler injection into previously irradiated sites, were described. The temporary effect of the materials used generates a need for reapplications but increases the safety of such procedures and enables patients' cancer treatment follow-up.

35777098	<TITLE>Design and synthesis of cellulose nanofiber-derived CoO/Co/C two-dimensional nanosheet toward enhanced and stable lithium storage.</TITLE>Nano-sized two-dimensional carbonaceous materials have been widely used as the matrix for alloying-type and conversion-type anode materials for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) to improve structural stability and rate performance. However, relevant synthesis usually requires rigorous conditions and chronic reaction processes. Herein, we have designed a simple solvothermal reaction and heat treatment to prepare a novel CoO/Co/C two-dimensional nanosheet (CoO/Co/C 2DNS) by adopting cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as the precursor. The unique characteristics of CNFs facilitate the uniform distribution of active materials on the surface and the construction of two-dimensional nanostructure via self-assembly. It is worth noting that CoO/Co/C 2DNS exhibits a striking synergistic effect since the porous 2D carbon framework offers additional pseudo-capacitance and enhances the electronic conductivity, while the ultrafine active materials encapsulated inside shorten the Li-ions diffusion pathways and relieve the volume change. Benefit from the unique structure, the composite anode delivered outstanding rate performance (∼500 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and superior long-range cycling performance up to 800 cycles even at 2 A g-1. This work provides a new strategy for the synthesis of nano-sized 2D composite, offering a promising route to construct high performance conversion-type anodes for next-generation LIBs.

35782342	<TITLE>Chemotherapy for patients with advanced lung cancer with interstitial lung disease: a prospective observational study.</TITLE>Although recent advances in chemotherapy for lung cancer are remarkable, most clinical trials have excluded patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) due to the concern of developing acute exacerbation (AE) of ILD. Hence, accumulating original evidence of cancer treatment for this population is important.|Between 2016 and 2020, a prospective observational study was conducted across 11 Japanese hospitals. Patients with chemotherapy-naïve, inoperable, advanced lung cancer with ILD were included. The primary outcome was the frequency of AE-ILD after registration; the secondary outcomes were the risk factor of AE-ILD and the efficacy of chemotherapy.|Among 124 patients enrolled, 109 patients who received chemotherapy were analyzed. The median age was 72 years, and the majority showed usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)/probable UIP pattern upon chest computed tomography. The median percent-predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) was 81% (interquartile range: 66-95%). After registration, 23 patients (21.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-29.7%) developed AE-ILD. The logistic analysis revealed that lower %FVC slightly but significantly increased the risk of AE-ILD (odds ratio per 10% decrease: 1.27; 95% CI: > 1.00-1.62). Overall response rates/median overall survival times in non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer for the first-line chemotherapy were 41% (95% CI: 31-53)/8.9 months (95% CI: 7.6-11.8) and 91% (95% CI: 76-98)/12.2 months (95% CI: 9.2-14.5), respectively.|AE-ILD during chemotherapy is a frequent complication among patients with lung cancer with ILD, particularly those with lower %FVC. Conversely, even in this population, passable treatment response can be expected.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35805175	<TITLE>Mining the Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Secretome in Patients with Chronic Left Ventricular Dysfunction.</TITLE>Close examination of the initial results of cardiovascular cell therapy clinical trials indicates the importance of patient-specific differences on outcomes and the need to optimize or customize cell therapies. The fields of regenerative medicine and cell therapy have transitioned from using heterogeneous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are believed to elicit benefits through paracrine activity. Here, we examined MSCs from the BMMNCs of heart failure patients enrolled in the FOCUS-CCTRN trial. We sought to identify differences in MSCs between patients who improved and those who declined in heart function, regardless of treatment received. Although we did not observe differences in the cell profile of MSCs between groups, we did find significant differences in the MSC secretome profile between patients who improved or declined. We conclude that "mining" the MSC secretome may provide clues to better understand the impact of patient characteristics on outcomes after cell therapy and this knowledge can inform future cell therapy trials.

35806385	<TITLE>The Multivalent Polyampholyte Domain of Nst1, a P-Body-Associated Saccharomyces cerevisiae Protein, Provides a Platform for Interacting with P-Body Components.</TITLE>The condensation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies, cytoplasmic P-granules, P-bodies (PBs), and stress granules is reversible and dynamic via liquid-liquid phase separation. Although each condensate comprises hundreds of proteins with promiscuous interactions, a few key scaffold proteins are required. Essential scaffold domain sequence elements, such as poly-Q, low-complexity regions, oligomerizing domains, and RNA-binding domains, have been evaluated to understand their roles in biomolecular condensation processes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We analyzed Nst1, a PB-associated protein that can intrinsically induce PB component condensations when overexpressed. Various Nst1 domain deletion mutants with unique sequence distributions, including intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and aggregation-prone regions, were constructed based on structural predictions. The overexpression of Nst1 deletion mutants lacking the aggregation-prone domain (APD) significantly inhibited self-condensation, implicating APD as an oligomerizing domain promoting self-condensation. Remarkably, cells overexpressing the Nst1 deletion mutant of the polyampholyte domain (PD) in the IDR region (Nst1∆PD) rarely accumulate endogenous enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Dcp2. However, Nst1∆PD formed self-condensates, suggesting that Nst1 requires PD to interact with Dcp2, regardless of its self-condensation. In Nst1∆PD-overexpressing cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX), Dcp2, Xrn1, Dhh1, and Edc3 had significantly diminished condensation compared to those in CHX-treated Nst1-overexpressing cells. These observations suggest that the PD of the IDR in Nst1 functions as a hub domain interacting with other PB components.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Therefore, we developed the Inventory of Physical Activity Barriers (IPAB).|Explore potential solutions that could address the current lack of PA prescription among United States-based physical therapists treating patients 50 years and older.|A convergent parallel mixed-method design consisting of focus groups and self-report questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used for all quantitative variables. Focus groups were thematically coded.|The 26 participants had 8.6 years (SD = 6.4) of clinical experience, 88.4% (n = 23) reported they regularly have PA conversations with patients, 65.4% (n = 17) regularly assess PA levels, and 19.2% (n = 5) regularly provide PA prescriptions. We identified three themes: 1) opportunities and challenges related to PA prescriptions; 2) lack of standardization in PA assessments and interventions; and 3) implementation potential for innovative solutions that address the current informal PA assessments and interventions.|Physical therapists are amenable to incorporating innovative solutions that support physical activity prescription behavior. Therefore, we recommend the continued development and implementation of PA assessment and prescription tools.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

35940935	<TITLE>Cataract, Cataract Surgery, and Risk of Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study of 300,823 Participants.</TITLE>Visual impairment and interventions to preserve vision may impact dementia risk. Thus, we aimed to explore the associations of cataract and cataract surgery with the risk of dementia.|Prospective data from 300,823 individuals in the UK Biobank were used. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for associations, with healthy control subjects as a reference. The same method was used to explore the effects of surgery on dementia outcomes of patients with cataract. One-way analysis of variance was performed to examine the associations between cataract and brain morphometric measures.|After a mean follow-up of 8.4 years, 3226 individuals were diagnosed with dementia. The nonsurgical cataract group had increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.012-1.456; p = .037) and Alzheimer's disease (HR, 1.479; 95% CI, 1.105-1.981; p = .009). However, there was no difference in dementia risk between the cataract surgery group and the healthy control group. Cataract surgery was associated with decreased risk of all-cause dementia (HR, 0.632; 95% CI, 0.421-0.947; p = .026) and Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.399; 95% CI, 0.196-0.812; p = .011) compared with the nonsurgical group. Additionally, cataract was negatively associated with cortical volumes, aging-related subcortical volumes, and fractional anisotropy of white matter fibers.|Cataract patients who did not receive surgical treatment had an increased risk of dementia. However, cataract surgery could reverse the risk of dementia. Our findings on brain structures and pathways in patients with cataract also provided evidence for the mechanism. Reversible visual impairment, such as cataract, is a promising modifiable risk factor for dementia.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
35988011	<TITLE>Factors affecting the growth, antioxidant potential, and secondary metabolites production in hazel callus cultures.</TITLE>Hazelnut is one of the most important nut plants recently suggested as a sustainable source for paclitaxel. In the present study, the effect of the concentration and combination of PGRs, different basal medium and ultrasonic waves on callus induction and growth, physiological characteristics, and taxol and baccatin III production in hazelnut callus cultures were investigated. The results indicated that combining 2,4-D (2 mg/L) and Kin (0.2 mg/L) with the sonication of explants for 1 min provides an optimized condition for callus induction and growth. Hazelnut explants exhibited different callus production and biochemical and metabolic characteristics depending on the basal medium type, ultrasound treatment, and inclusion of ascorbic acid in the medium. So that, the highest percentage of callogenesis (100%) observed in ½ MS + 1 min US, ½ MS + 150 mg/L AA, B5 + 1 min US and B5 + 150 mg/L AA, and also ½ MS salt + Nitsch vitamins + 150 mg/L AA. Furthermore, the highest callus growth (7.86 g FW) was obtained from ½ MS + 1 min US. The highest amount of baccatin III production (147.98 and 147.85 mg/L) was obtained from the WPM and MS basal media; the highest taxol production (44.89 mg/L) was observed in the WPM basal medium. The cultures in the MS, WPM, and MS salts + Nitsch vitamins media, had the highest H2O2 and MDA content, antioxidant enzymes activity, and phenolic compounds. In conclusion, culture media nutrient composition and concentration not only affect the cell growth and physiological status of the cultures but also improve secondary metabolites production and accumulation.

36003943	<TITLE>Genome-wide characterization of laccase gene family in Schizophyllum commune 20R-7-F01, isolated from deep sediment 2 km below the seafloor.</TITLE>Laccases are ligninolytic enzymes that play a crucial role in various biological processes of filamentous fungi, including fruiting-body formation and lignin degradation. Lignin degradation is a complex process and its degradation in Schizophyllum commune is greatly affected by the availability of oxygen. Here, a total of six putative laccase genes (ScLAC) were identified from the S. commune 20R-7-F01 genome. These genes, which include three typical Cu-oxidase domains, can be classified into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. ScLAC showed distinct intron-exon structures and conserved motifs, suggesting the conservation and diversity of ScLAC in gene structures. Additionally, the number and type of cis-acting elements, such as substrate utilization-, stress-, cell division- and transcription activation-related cis-elements, varied between ScLAC genes, suggesting that the transcription of laccase genes in S. commune 20R-7-F01 could be induced by different substrates, stresses, or other factors. The SNP analysis of resequencing data demonstrated that the ScLAC of S. commune inhabiting deep subseafloor sediments were significantly different from those of S. commune inhabiting terrestrial environments. Similarly, the large variation of conserved motifs number and arrangement of laccase between subseafloor and terrestrial strains indicated that ScLAC had a diverse structure. The expression of ScLAC5 and ScLAC6 genes was significantly up-regulated in lignin/lignite medium, suggesting that these two laccase genes might be involved in fungal utilization and degradation of lignite and lignin under anaerobic conditions. These findings might help in understanding the function of laccase in white-rot fungi and could provide a scientific basis for further exploring the relationship between the LAC family and anaerobic degradation of lignin by S. commune.

36052313	<TITLE>Factors affecting compliance with infection prevention and control standard precautions among healthcare workers in Songwe region, Tanzania.</TITLE>Compliance with infection prevention and control standard precautions (IPCSPs) remains a major challenge in many countries including Tanzania. Lack of compliance exposes healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients to a high risk of developing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) including antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms which can contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study investigated compliance with IPCSPs and associated factors among HCWs in public healthcare facilities (HFs) in Songwe Region, Tanzania between January and March 2021.|A cross-sectional study was conducted in all 5 districts in Songwe Region, involved 400 HCWs from difference healthcare facilities (HFs) including dispensaries, health centres and hospitals. The Compliance with Standard Precautions scale (CSPS) tool developed by WHO was used. Descriptive and modified Poisson regression analysis was done. A P-value of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance.|Only 22.5% (90/400) of HCWs had high compliance (above 80%) to IPCSPs. The majority of HCWs reported highest compliance on discarding used needles/sharps into sharps containers (94%), the lowest IPCSPs compliance was for the correct handling of spills, taking a shower after extensive splashing and not re-using disposable masks, 8%, 28.5% and 34% respectively. Attending IPC training or an IPC seminar in the previous year (ARR=2.97 [1.87-4.72] P<0.001), the number of years of work experience (ARR=2.08 [1.22-3.54] P=0.007), and having experienced a needlestick injury (ARR=0.62 [0.40-0.95] P=0.028), were identified as predictors of HCWs compliance with IPCSPs.|The majority of HCWs in Songwe region had low compliance with IPCSPs according to national standards. IPC training and the number of years of work experience predicted high compliance with IPCSPs. Capacity building initiatives, mentorship and supportive supervision should be emphasised for all HCWs in all HFs.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36059925	<TITLE>Quantitative Analysis of Berberidis Cortex via Quantitative Analysis of Multicomponents by Single Marker (QAMS) Combined with Fingerprint and Chemometrics Methods.</TITLE>Berberidis Cortex is rich in alkaloids, and many of them have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic activities. However, few research studies have focused on the quantitative analysis of multiple components from Berberidis Cortex. In this study, a new quality evaluation strategy for Berberidis Cortex was developed and validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which involved single marker, fingerprint, and stoichiometric methods. Using berberine hydrochloride as an internal reference, the relative correction factors of palmatine hydrochloride, magnoline, and jatrorrhizine hydrochloride were 2.4537, 0.9783, and 1.0035, respectively, and their durabilities were also well performed. In addition, both methods mentioned above were used to compare the mass fractions of four isoquinoline alkaloids in ten batches of Berberidis Cortex from different origins. These results indicated that the approach applied in this study was accurate and feasible. The fingerprints of these ten batches of Berberidis Cortex were established, and eleven components were identified with the similarity greater than 0.993. Both cluster and principal component analysis were carried out based on the peak area of these components, the results demonstrated that these ten batches of Berberidis Cortex were divided into two groups and the distribution of the medicinal material was basically consistent. Therefore, quantitative analysis of multicomponents by single marker (QAMS) can be widely used in the quality control of Berberidis Cortex as theoretical basis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36087908	<TITLE>Small Synthetic Hyaluronan Disaccharide BIS014 Mitigates Neuropathic Pain in Mice.</TITLE>Neuropathic pain (NP) is a challenging condition to treat, as the need for new drugs to treat NP is an unmet goal. We investigated the analgesic potential of a new sulfated disaccharide compound, named BIS014. Oral administration (p.o.) of this compound induced ameliorative effects in formalin-induced nociception and capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hypersensitivity in mice, but also after partial sciatic nerve transection (spared nerve injury), chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced NP, and diabetic neuropathy induced by streptozotocin. Importantly, BIS014, at doses active on neuropathic hypersensitivity (60 mg/kg/p.o.), did not alter exploratory activity or motor coordination (in the rotarod test), unlike a standard dose of gabapentin (40 mg/kg/p.o.) which although inducing antiallodynic effects on the NP models, it also markedly decreased exploration and motor coordination. In docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, BIS014 interacted with TRPV1, a receptor involved in pain transmission where it behaved as a partial agonist. Additionally, similar to capsaicin, BIS014 increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) in neuroblastoma cells expressing TRPV1 receptors; these elevations were blocked by ruthenium red. BIS014 did not block capsaicin-elicited [Ca2+]c transients, but inhibited the increase in the firing rate of action potentials in bradykinin-sensitized dorsal root ganglion neurons stimulated with capsaicin. Perspective: We report that the oral administration of a new sulfated disaccharide compound, named BIS014, decreases neuropathic pain from diverse etiology in mice. Unlike the comparator gabapentin, BIS014 does not induce sedation. Thus, BIS014 has the potential to become a new efficacious non-sedative oral medication for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

36093308	<TITLE>Virus and Autoimmunity: Can SARS-CoV-2 Trigger Large Vessel Vasculitis?</TITLE>Viral infections can induce autoimmune diseases in susceptible patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with the development of rheumatic disease, especially small vessel vasculitis and arthritis. Typically, onset occurs days to weeks after the antigenic challenge and in patients with mild COVID-19. We report a case of large vessel vasculitis (LVV) temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.|An otherwise healthy 19-year-old woman presented with fatigue, malaise, and chest and low back pain. The symptoms had begun 5 weeks earlier and 1 month after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological work-up revealed a marked proinflammatory state and anaemia without signs of infectious or autoimmune disease. Computerized tomography revealed thickening and blurring of the perivascular fat of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, progressing along the proximal iliac and renal arteries. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography confirmed inflammatory activity. Symptoms and laboratory values normalized after prednisolone treatment.|Recent SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a trigger for LVV, including Takayasu arteritis, as well as other rheumatic diseases. A prompt and thorough differential diagnosis is essential to exclude aortitis and LVV mimickers. Moreover, physicians should be aware of the potential spectrum of systemic and autoimmune diseases that could be precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This will allow timely diagnosis and treatment, with significant improvement in prognosis.|SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger large vessel vasculitis and other rheumatic diseases.Awareness of the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune phenomena allows for timely diagnosis and treatment with significant improvements in prognosis.Vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases should be kept in mind in patients who develop proinflammatory states days to weeks after an initial antigenic challenge.

36176348	<TITLE>The Development of Schematics to Illustrate Women's Experiences with Adjuvant Hormone Therapy in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.</TITLE>Non-adherence to adjuvant hormone therapy prescribed orally in the treatment of breast cancer is complex as the literature has shown. Many women find it hard to adhere to the hormonal medicines they are prescribed and expected to take for at least 5 years following the initial management of their breast cancer. Arguably, communicating other women's 'trials, tribulations, and triumphs' with medication-taking could help newly-diagnosed patients to better prepare for the journey ahead. Our objective was to visually represent women's experiences with these medicines using data synthesized in the literature.|Three schematics were drawn for each phase of medication-taking, namely, starting out, adherence, and cessation. The schematics were validated by interviewing a panel of healthcare professionals (n=10) and calculating a Content Validity Index (CVI). The edited drawings were discussed with a separate panel of breast cancer survivors (n=14) whose responses were elicited qualitatively in one-to-one interviews.|A total of 76 individual pictograms were drawn across the three schematics. The 13 pictograms that had an item-level CVI<0.8 were modified according to feedback resulting in three final schematics with an overall CVI of 87%, 87% and 80%, respectively.|Synthesised summaries of women's experiences with oral hormone therapy for breast cancer were visualised via three validated schematics.

In 2018, we concluded a deprescribing pilot study that reduced potentially inappropriate medication use among LTC residents.|We sought to understand the experience and views of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, LTC residents and family members who participated in the pilot study.|Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with residents and families, a physician, pharmacist and pharmacy student, and licensed-practical nurses. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach.|Interviews with 13 participants yielded themes in 3 categories: (1) views about medication use in LTC and willingness to engage in deprescribing, (2) perceived barriers and enablers for deprescribing, and (3) impact of participating in deprescribing study. Participants were willing to engage in deprescribing; residents were motivated by physician suggestions, and family members prioritized quality of life in decision-making and wanted to be part of the decision-making process. Solutions to overcome barriers included assigning responsibility to identify deprescribing opportunities to pharmacists, scheduling rounds to enable face-to-face team discussions, and consulting families to provide missing medical history to inform deprescribing decisions. Participating in a deprescribing intervention resulted in improved healthcare professional (HCP) confidence and interprofessional collaboration, and caused continued practice change after the study.|Residents, families, and HCPs are concerned about problems associated with polypharmacy in LTC and are willing to consider deprescribing. Barriers to deprescribing in LTC exist but are not insurmountable. Results provide valuable insight into strategies to optimize deprescribing interventions within LTC.

36235477	<TITLE>Chemical Constituents and Their Production in Mexican Oaks (Q. Rugosa, Q. Glabrescens and Q. Obtusata).</TITLE>Mexico is considered one of the main regions of diversification of the genus Quercus (oaks). Oak species are one of the most important tree groups, particularly in temperate forests, due to its diversity and abundance. Some studies have shown that oak contains specialized metabolites with medicinal importance. In this work, the acetonic extract from leaves of three Mexican oaks (Quercus rugosa, Q. glabrescens, and Q. obtusata) was separated using thin-layer chromatography and column chromatography. Chemical identification of the major compounds was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Nineteen compounds were identified, three belonging to the terpenoid family (ursolic acid, β-amyrin, and β-sitosterol) and 16 from the phenolic family. Of the isolated compounds, seven are new reports for oak species (scopoletin, ursolic acid, β-amyrin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-O-sambubioside). More compounds were identified in Q. rugosa followed by Q. glabrescens and then Q. obtusata. The characterization of specialized metabolites in oak species is relevant, from both phytocentric and anthropocentric perspectives.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36242792	<TITLE>Potential impact of ultrasound, pulsed electric field, high-pressure processing and microfludization against thermal treatments preservation regarding sugarcane juice (Saccharum officinarum).</TITLE>Sugarcane juice (Saccharum officinarum) is a proven nutritious beverage with high levels of antioxidants, polyphenols, and other beneficial nutrients. It has recently gained consumer interest due to its high nutritional profile and alkaline nature. Still, high polyphenolic and sugar content start the fermentation in juice, resulting in dark coloration. Lately, some novel techniques have been introduced to extend shelf life and improve the nutritional value of sugarcane juice. The introduction of such processing technologies is beneficial over conventional processes and essential for producing chemical-free, high-quality, fresh juices. The synergistic impact of these novel technologies is also advantageous for preserving sugarcane juice. In literature, novel thermal, non-thermal and hurdle technologies have been executed to preserve sugarcane juice. These technologies include high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), ultrasound (US), pulsed electric field (PEF), ultraviolet irradiation (UV), ohmic heating (OH), microwave (MW), microfludization and ozone treatment. This review manifests the impact of novel thermal, non-thermal, and synergistic technologies on sugarcane juice processing and preservation characteristics. Non-thermal techniques have been successfully proved effective and showed better results than novel thermal treatments. Because they reduced microbial load and retained nutritional content, while thermal treatments degraded nutrients and flavor of sugarcane juice. Among non-thermal treatments, HHP is the most efficient technique for the preservation of sugarcane juice while OH is preferable in thermal techniques due to less nutritional loss.

36262665	<TITLE>Transcriptome characteristics during cell wall formation of endosperm cellularization and embryo differentiation in Arabidopsis.</TITLE>Embryonic and endosperm development are important biological events during Arabidopsis seed development, and are controlled by dynamic changes in a range of gene expression. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of endosperm cellularization and embryo differentiation remain unclear. Here, we characterized the early embryo and endosperm development of the naa15 mutant that had abnormal embryo differentiation and incomplete endosperm cellularization compared to WT of Arabidopsis, and comparatively investigated the changes of gene expressions in WT seeds at 3, 4, and 5 days after pollination (3W, 4W, and 5W) and the white homozygous aborted naa15 seeds at 5, 6, and 7 DAP (5M, 6M, and 7M) from naa15-1/+ siliques using RNA sequencing and qPCR assays. The transcriptome analyses showed that there were 2040 and 3630 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 4W (at endosperm cellularization initiation stage and heart embryo stage) vs 3W (at syncytium stage and globular embryo stage), and 5W (at end of endosperm cellularization stage and torpedo embryo stage) vs 4W, respectively. The KEGG and GO analyses showed that lipid metabolic processes and transmembrane transport related to cell wall biogenesis, cell division and differentiation, the plant hormone signaling pathway, photosynthesis, and transcription regulator activity were evidently enriched in WT and naa15. The heatmap and qPCR analyses showed that auxin response genes (ARFs), auxin transport genes (PINs) cytokinin synthesis genes (LOGs), cytokinin dehydrogenase genes (CKXs), cytokinin receptor, transcription factors (MYB, bHLH, MADS-box, and ERF) were significantly downregulated in naa15 compared to WT. A series of cell wall genes annotated to xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase, pectin methyl esterase, and pectin methyl esterase inhibitor were also identified in these DEGs. Moreover, using an immunofluorescent assay, the features of cell walls displayed that cellulose fluorescence signals in the embryo and endosperm of naa15 were significantly decreased, and the signals of low- and high- methyl esterification of pectin were also obviously decreased in the endosperm of naa15. In summary, we identified a large number of DEGs and investigated the features of cell walls during endosperm cellularization and embryonic differentiation, which provided important information on transcription and gene expression to reveal their regulatory mechanisms.

36276931	<TITLE>Treatment of Pediatric Patients With High-Flow Nasal Cannula and Considerations for Oral Feeding: A Review of the Literature.</TITLE>High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has become an increasingly common means of noninvasive respiratory support in pediatrics and is being used in infants and children with respiratory distress both inside and outside of the intensive care units. Despite the widespread use of HFNC, there remains a paucity of data on optimal flow rates and its impact on morbidity, mortality, and desired outcomes. Given the scarcity of information in these critical areas, it is not surprising that guidelines for initiation of oral feeding do not exist. This review article will review HFNC mechanisms of action, its use in specific populations and settings, and finally what is known about initiation of feeding during this therapy.|The practice of withholding oral feeding solely, because of HFNC, is not supported in the literature at the time of this writing, but in the absence of safety data from clinical trials, clinicians should proceed with caution and consider patient-specific factors while making decisions about oral feeding. Well-controlled prospective clinical trials are needed for development of best practice clinical guidelines and attainment of optimal outcomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36299523	<TITLE>Isolation, characterization and anti-UVB irradiation activity of an extracellular polysaccharide produced by Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus VHPriobi O17.</TITLE>The purpose of this study was to isolate exopolysaccharides (EPS) from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and evaluate EPS anti-UVB viability. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus VHPriobi O17 with high EPS production was screened from 34 strains of LAB. The EPS (OP-2) produced by L. rhamnosus VHPriobi O17 was purified by alcohol precipitation and DEAE-μSphere anion exchange chromatography. By ion chromatography, FT-IR spectrum and gel column chromatography, EPS (OP-2) was a novel Man-like polysaccharide with the weight-averaged molecular of 84.2 kDa. The EPS (OP-2) can effectively alleviate HaCaT cells apoptosis and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by UVB. The results also showed that it inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8); and suppressed the phosphorylation cascade of JNK and p38 MAPK to reduce the expression level of active-caspase3, ultimately prevented cell apoptosis. Thus, the EPS produced by L. rhamnosus VHPriobi O17 have the potential to be used for human anti-UVB irradiation.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36399157	<TITLE>Butyrate Enhances γ-H2AX Induced by Benzo[a]pyrene.</TITLE>Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is known to form DNA adduct following metabolic activation, which causes phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX). Recent studies have shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors enhanced BaP-induced CYP1A1 gene expression. In this study, we examined the relationship between the HDAC inhibitor-augmented metabolic activation and BaP-induced γ-H2AX. Sodium butyrate (SB), a typical HDAC inhibitor, enhanced BaP-induced γ-H2AX. The enhanced DNA damage was further confirmed by biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis, which detects DNA double-strand breaks. SB remarkably augmented BaP-induced CYP1A1 gene expression, and CYP1A1-overexpressing cells showed elevated generation of γ-H2AX. Furthermore, SB enhanced intracellular oxidation after treatment with BaP. These results suggested that SB-induced CYP1A1 upregulation facilitated BaP metabolism, which might result in excess DNA adducts or oxidative DNA damages, leading to augmentation of γ-H2AX.

In this study, the IPFT agent used was alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This study aims to determine the difference in the outcome of patients with complex pleural effusion between IPFT and surgery in terms of radiological improvement, inflammatory parameters, length of stay, and post-intervention complications.|A retrospective review of patients with complex pleural effusion treated at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center from January 2012 to August 2020 was performed. Patient demographics, chest imaging, drainage chart, inflammatory parameters, length of hospital stay, and post-intervention and outcome were analyzed.|Fifty-eight patients were identified (surgical intervention, n = 18; 31% and IPFT, n = 40, 69%). The mean age was 51.7 ± 18.2 years. Indication for surgical intervention was pleural infection (n = 18; 100%), and MPE (n = 0). Indications for IPFT was pleural infection (n = 30; 75%) and MPE (n = 10; 25%). The dosages of t-PA were one to five doses of 2-50 mg. The baseline chest radiograph in the IPFT group was worse than in the surgical intervention group. (119.96 ± 56.05 vs. 78.19 ± 55.6; p = 0.029) At week 1, the radiological success rate for IPFT and surgical intervention were 27% and 20%, respectively, and at weeks 4-8, the success rate was 56% and 80% respectively. IPFT was associated with lesser complications; fever (17.5%), chest pain (10%), and non-life-threatening bleeding (5%).|IPFT was comparable to surgery in radiological outcome, inflammatory parameters, and length of stay with lesser reported complications.

We investigated in this study whether 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing analysis of the uterine microbiome improves pregnancy outcomes.|This prospective cohort study recruited a total of 195 women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) between March 2019 and April 2021 in our fertility center. Analysis of the endometrial microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was suggested for all patients who had three or more failed embryo transfers (ETs). One hundred and thirty-one patients underwent microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (study group) before additional transfers, while 64 patients proceeded to ET without that analysis (control group). The primary outcome was to compare the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate of two additional ETs.|An endometrial microbiota considered abnormal was detected in 30 patients (22.9%). All but one of these 30 patients received antibiotics according to the bacterial genus detected in their sample, followed by treatment with probiotics.

36616926	<TITLE>Neutron and Gamma-Ray Detection System Coupled to a Multirotor for Screening of Shipping Container Cargo.</TITLE>In order to detect special nuclear materials and other radioactive materials in Security and Defense scenarios, normally, a combination of neutron and gamma-ray detection systems is used. In particular, to avoid illicit traffic of special nuclear materials and radioactive sources/materials, radiation portal monitors are placed at seaports to inspect shipping-container cargo. Despite their large volume (high efficiency), these detection systems are expensive, and therefore only a fraction of these containers are inspected. In this work, a novel mobile radiation detection system is presented, based on an EJ-200 plastic scintillator for the detection of gamma rays and beta particles, and a neutron detector EJ-426HD plastic scintillator (with 6Li) embedded in a compact and modular moderator. The use of silicon photomultipliers in both detectors presented advantages such as lightweight, compactness, and low power consumption. The developed detection system was integrated in a highly maneuverable multirotor. Monte Carlo simulations were validated by laboratory measurements and field tests were performed using real gamma-ray and neutron sources. The detection and localization within one meter was achieved using a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for 137Cs sources (4 MBq), as well as the detection of 241Am-beryllium (1.45 GBq) source placed inside the shipping container.

36689203	<TITLE>Performance Deficiency Improvement of CNT-Based Strain Sensors by Magnetic-Induced Patterning.</TITLE>As one of the most promising candidates, ubiquitous cycling degradation seriously affects the accuracy of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based sensors, and the reason for which is still unclear. Herein, the cycling degradation mechanism of CNT-based strain sensors has been detected by comparatively investigating the difference between the sensing behavior of CNT- and silver nanowire (Ag-NW)-based sensors, from which the microcrack-disconnection and unfolding-tunneling effects have been clarified as the sensing mechanism for Ag-NWs and CNT-based strain sensors, respectively. Furthermore, sliding and unfolding behaviors resulting from the weak interaction between CNTs have been proven to cause degradation. Correspondingly, a creative magnetically induced patterning method is proposed by utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as obstacles to prevent the CNTs from relative sliding. Benefiting from the advantageous factor, the performance deficiency of the CNT-based sensor has been overcome, and the sensitivity was significantly improved up to 5.2 times with accurate human activity detection. The competitive sensing performance of the CNTs demonstrates the reference value of the deficiency mechanism and solution scheme obtained in this study.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

However, SHLPI is extracted from pure Chinese medicine and administered through an injection, and many adverse reactions have been reported clinically. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize in depth the chemical composition of SHLPI and quantitatively analyze its potential allergenic components.|In this study, the samples were analyzed using ion mobility ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) combined with a self-built database. Furthermore, the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) model of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-Orbitrap-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS) was used to successfully quantify 10 representative bioactive components.|Using this strategy 90 compounds were identified, the fragmentation pathways of five representative compounds in the five main components of SHLPI were summarized, and 10 components (neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, sweroside, forsythiaside A, luteoloside, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid C, baicalin, phillyrin, and baicalein) were determine as the quality markers of SHLPI based on UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS.|This work comprehensively characterized the material basis of SHLPI, summarized the cracking laws of representative substances, and quantitatively analyzed 10 potential allergenic components.

36698132	<TITLE>Plasmodium malariae contributes to high levels of malaria transmission in a forest-savannah transition area in Cameroon.</TITLE>Malaria control efforts are highly skewed towards Plasmodium falciparum while overlooking other Plasmodium species such as P. malariae. A better understanding of the role of Plasmodium species other than P. falciparum is needed to strengthen malaria elimination initiatives. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the contribution of P. malariae to malaria transmission in Cameroon.|The study was conducted in the Ngatti Health District, a forest-savannah transition area in the Adamawa Region, Cameroon. A total of 497 individuals aged from 1 to 85 years were diagnosed with malaria in November 2020 using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopy. Adult mosquitoes were collected between September 2019 and March 2020 by indoor aspiration and identified morphologically and molecularly. The infection status of Plasmodium spp. was also determined by quantitative PCR, and dried blood spots were collected from 156 participants with the aim to detect different Plasmodium species by nested PCR.|The overall Plasmodium prevalence was 50.3%, 51.8% and 64.7%, as detected by microscopy, the RDT and PCR, respectively. Based on the PCR results, P. falciparum was the most prevalent species (43%); followed by co-infections P. falciparum/P. malariae (17%), P. falciparum/P. ovale (1.3%), P. falciparum/P. ovale/P. malariae (1.3%); and then by P. malariae mono-infection (2.5%). The same trend was observed using microscopy, with 35% of participants infected with P. falciparum, 11% co-infected with P. falciparum/P. malariae and 4% infected with P. malariae. The prevalence and parasite density of malaria infection varied significantly with age group (P < 0.05), with the highest prevalence rate observed in children aged 6-10 years (P = 0.0001) while the density of Plasmodium infection increased significantly in children aged < 5 years compared to the other age groups (P = 10-3). Among the 757 Anopheles mosquitoes collected, 737 (97.35%) were An. funestus sensu stricto, 15 (1.9%) were An. gambiae and 5 (0.6%) were An. hancocki. The Plasmodium species recorded at the head/thorax level were P. falciparum and P. malariae, with a sporozoite infection rate of 8.4%; the highest sporozoite infection rate was recorded at Mibellon village (13.6%).|The results of this study reveal the significant contribution of P. malariae, in addition to P. falciparum, to the high malaria transmission rate in this region. These findings highlight the need to deploy initiatives to also tackle this Plasmodium species to eliminate malaria in the region.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36787505	<TITLE>Clinicogenomic Landscape of Metastatic Thymic Epithelial Tumors.</TITLE>Despite favorable clinical outcomes, a subset of patients with thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) develop metastasis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides genomic data on primary TETs (pTETs). This study assessed the molecular alterations and uncovered targetable pathways in metastatic TETs (mTETs).|From 2015 to 2020, 49 patients with stage IV TETs underwent Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-based sequencing using whole-exome sequencing (n = 33), panel-based testing (n = 12), and/or liquid biopsy (n = 24). Specimens were obtained from a metastatic organ (n = 36) or relapsed primary mediastinal mass (n = 10), whereas four patients underwent a liquid biopsy only. Data on pTETs were derived from the TCGA.|Compared with the pTET data set, patients with mTETs were younger (54 years v 60.5 years, P = .009) and had more aggressive histologies, with the most common tumor type being thymic carcinoma (n = 22, 40.7%) and B3 thymoma (n = 15, 27.8%). GTF2I was the most altered gene in primary thymomas (48.80%, n = 60). In metastatic thymoma and thymic carcinoma, TP53 was the most common genetic alteration (31% and 36%, respectively). In mTETs, the genomic alteration occurred in the TP53/CDK, EGFR/RAS, and PI3K/mTOR pathways. Biopsies obtained from distant metastasis were more commonly found to contain targetable mutations. There was an overlap of 61% (22 of 36) between tissue and liquid biopsy genomic alterations.|Clinically actionable genomic alterations are frequently observed in mTETs, indicating a value of repeat biopsy (preferably from a metastatic site of TETs for sequencing at the time of recurrence (TCGA data).

36824318	<TITLE>Standardized Nursing Diagnoses in a Surgical Hospital Setting: A Retrospective Study Based on Electronic Health Data.</TITLE>In electronic health records (EHRs), standardized nursing terminologies (SNTs), such as nursing diagnoses (NDs), are needed to demonstrate the impact of nursing care on patient outcomes. Unfortunately, the use of NDs is not common in clinical practice, especially in surgical settings, and is rarely included in EHRs.|The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence and trend of NDs in a hospital surgical setting by also analyzing the relationship between NDs and hospital outcomes.|A retrospective study was conducted. All adult inpatients consecutively admitted to one of the 15 surgical inpatient units of an Italian university hospital across 1 year were included. Data, including the Professional Assessment Instrument and the Hospital Discharge Register, were collected retrospectively from the hospital's EHRs.|The sample included 5,027 surgical inpatients. There was a mean of 6.3 ± 4.3 NDs per patient. The average distribution of NDs showed a stable trend throughout the year. The most representative NANDA-I ND domain was safety/protection. The total number of NDs on admission was significantly higher for patient whose length of stay was longer. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the number of NDs on admission and the number of intra-hospital patient transfers. Additionally, the mean number of NDs on admission was higher for patients who were later transferred to an intensive care unit compared to those who were not transferred.|NDs represent the key to understanding the contribution of nurses in the surgical setting. NDs collected upon admission can represent a prognostic factor related to the hospital's key outcomes.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

This study aims to describe the extent of visual morbidity following globe-sparing excision, and the clinicoradiological characteristics of tumor recurrence.|Multicentre retrospective case series.|Eight patients were identified for inclusion in this series. Time to recurrence following globe-sparing excision ranged from 3 to 12 years. Seven patients (87.5%) presented with recurrent disease originating from the medial canthus. Clinical features at presentation included contracture ( n =4, 50.0%), upper lid ptosis ( n =3, 37.5%), a palpable mass ( n =2, 25.0%), and hypoesthesia ( n =2, 25.0%). Radiologically, tumor recurrence was predominantly characterized by isointense signals on T1 and T2-weighted sequences ( n =5, 62.5%) with moderate contrast enhancement. The most common histologic subtype in recurrent tumors was a mixed nodular and infiltrative growth pattern ( n =5, 62.5%). Perineural invasion was a feature in four (50%) cases. Salvage therapy in the form of exenteration was performed in seven cases. Vismodegib and adjuvant radiotherapy were provided for one case with surgically unresectable tumor recurrence.|Globe-sparing excision for invasive periocular BCC can be complicated by late recurrence that develops rapidly despite silent neuroimaging for years. Early clinical signs are subtle. High-risk features predictive of recurrence include medial canthus location, mixed histological subtypes, and perineural invasion. Patients with such characteristics require lifelong clinical and imaging surveillance following globe-sparing excision.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
36943884	<TITLE>The balance between gasdermin D and STING signaling shapes the severity of schistosome immunopathology.</TITLE>There is significant disease heterogeneity among mouse strains infected with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni. Here, we uncover a unique balance in two critical innate pathways governing the severity of disease. In the low-pathology setting, parasite egg-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) induce robust interferon (IFN)β production, which is dependent on the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and results in a Th2 response with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production and Th17 cell activation. IFNβ induces signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, which suppresses CD209a, a C-type lectin receptor associated with severe disease. In contrast, in the high-pathology setting, enhanced DC expression of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (Gsdmd) results in reduced expression of cGAS/STING, impaired IFNβ, and enhanced pyroptosis. Our findings demonstrate that cGAS/STING signaling represents a unique mechanism inducing protective type I IFN, which is counteracted by Gsdmd.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

37032456	<TITLE>Genetic variation and population structure of a widely distributed damselfly (Ischnura senegalensis).</TITLE>Ischnura senegalensis Rambur, 1842 is among the most widespread damselfly species in the world. Unlike dragonflies with strong migration abilities, I. senegalensis have limited dispersing abilities. Gene flow among I. senegalensis populations may be greatly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance, fragmented suitable habitats, sea straits, or even global warming. In this study, to investigate the genetic diversity of I. senegalensis populations, we sequenced and collected 498 cytochrome oxidase I sequences across the Old World. Haplotype network analysis showed 51 haplotypes and I. senegalensis could be grouped into four regions (Afrotropical region, Oriental region, main Islands of Japan, and the Ryukyu Islands), each of which contains different dominant haplotypes. Based on molecular variance analysis, we found that populations from the Afrotropical region have quite a low gene flow with the Asian populations (except Yemen). Furthermore, rice cultivation may aid the dispersion of I. senegalensis in the oriental region. Populations from the Ryukyu Islands show the highest genetic diversity, which may be due to the geological separation among islands. Our results prove that I. senegalensis has great genetic diversity among different populations across the world.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37047963	<TITLE>Simulation on Heat Transfer and Emergency Protection of Tanks in a Tank Farm under Fire Scenario.</TITLE>It is very important to understand the heat transfer process between storage tanks in a tank farm under a fire scenario, which is one of the key factors in determining the consequences of accident development. In this paper, a CFD simulation is used to study the heat transfer process and emergency protection of tanks under a fire scenario. The simulated results show that the changes in wind speed can affect the heat transfer of the tank farm. The highest temperature of the tanks at 5.3 m/s (wind speed) is 1432 K, while the highest temperature at 17.1 m/s (wind speed) is 1556 K. At the same time, the changes in wind direction can also affect the heat transfer of the tank farm. For the 45° east by north (wind direction), almost all tanks in the tank farm are affected by the fire. When the water curtain was applied as an emergency protection measure, the simulated highest temperature of the tanks decreased to 779 K (the cooling water intensity 6 L/min·m2), while the highest temperature of the tanks was 1432 K without water curtain protection under the actual fire conditions. The simulated highest temperature of the tanks decreased to 671 K when the emergency thermal insulation coating was sprayed on the surface of the tanks, which can effectively protect the adjacent tanks from being destroyed.

37064874	<TITLE>Single-cell profiling of GP2-enriched pancreatic progenitors to simultaneously create acinar, ductal, and endocrine organoids.</TITLE>Rationale: Pancreatic lineage specification follows the formation of tripotent pancreatic progenitors (PPs). Current protocols rebuilding PPs in vitro have an endocrine lineage bias and are mostly based on PDX1/NKX6-1 coexpression neglecting other markers decisive for PP heterogeneity and lineage potential. However, true tripotent PPs are of utmost interest to study also exocrine disorders such as pancreatic cancer and to simultaneously generate all three pancreatic lineages from the same ancestor. Methods: Here, we performed a comprehensive compound testing to advance the generation of multipotent progenitors, which were further characterized for their trilineage potential in vitro and in vivo. The heterogeneity and cell-cell communication across the PP subpopulations were analyzed via single-cell transcriptomics. Results: We introduce a novel PP differentiation platform based on a comprehensive compound screening with an advanced design of experiments computing tool to reduce impurities and to increase Glycoprotein-2 expression and subsequent trilineage potential. Superior PP tripotency was proven in vitro by the generation of acinar, endocrine, and ductal cells as well as in vivo upon orthotopic transplantation revealing all three lineages at fetal maturation level. GP2 expression levels at PP stage ascribed varying pancreatic lineage potential. Intermediate and high GP2 levels were superior in generating endocrine and duct-like organoids (PDLO). FACS-based purification of the GP2high PPs allowed the generation of pancreatic acinar-like organoids (PALO) with proper morphology and expression of digestive enzymes. scRNA-seq confirmed multipotent identity, positioned the GP2/PDX1/NKX6-1high population next to human fetal tip and trunk progenitors and identified novel ligand-receptor (LR) interactions in distinct PP subpopulations. LR validation experiments licensed midkine and VEGF signaling to increase markers labelling the single cell clusters with high GP2 expression. Conclusion: In this study, we guide human pluripotent stem cells into multipotent pancreatic progenitors. This common precursor population, which has the ability to mature into acinar, ductal and functional β-cells, serves as a basis for studying developmental processes and deciphering early cancer formation in a cell type-specific context. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validation studies, we were able to dissect PP heterogeneity and specific cell-cell communication signals.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37070780	<TITLE>Reporting Standards for Diagnostic Testing: Guidance for Authors From Editors of Respiratory, Sleep, and Critical Care Journals.</TITLE>Diagnostic testing is fundamental to medicine. However, studies of diagnostic testing in respiratory medicine vary significantly in terms of their methodology, definitions, and reporting of results. This has led to often conflicting or ambiguous results. To address this issue, a group of 20 respiratory journal editors worked to develop reporting standards for studies of diagnostic testing based on a rigorous methodology to guide authors, peer reviewers, and researchers when conducting studies of diagnostic testing in respiratory medicine. Four key areas are covered, including defining the reference standard of truth, measures of dichotomous test performance when used for dichotomous outcomes, measures of multichotomous test performance for dichotomous outcomes, and what constitutes a useful definition of diagnostic yield. The importance of using contingency tables for reporting results is addressed with examples from the literature. A practical checklist is provided as well for reporting studies of diagnostic testing.

ONSD was measured from axial CT images, 3 and 10 mm behind the optic globe.|The normative values of ONSD measured on CT imaging in children aged 1 to 16 years were reported. The change in ONSD according to age was investigated. ONSD was found to increase with age at both levels measured. The difference was statistically significant.|Normal values should be known to detect pathologies that may cause an increase in optic nerve diameter. The values reported in this study can serve as a reference for normal optic nerve sheath diameter in the pediatric age group. [J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 20XX;X(X):XX-XX.].

37098294	<TITLE>Clinical, histopathological and molecular features of dedifferentiated melanomas: An EORTC Melanoma Group Retrospective Analysis.</TITLE>Dedifferentiated melanoma (DedM) poses significant diagnostic challenges. We aimed to investigate the clinical, histopathological and molecular features of DedM. Methylation signature (MS) and copy number profiling (CNP) were carried out in a subgroup of cases.|A retrospective series of 78 DedM tissue samples from 61 patients retrieved from EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Melanoma Group centres were centrally reviewed. Clinical and histopathological features were retrieved. In a subgroup of patients, genotyping through Infinium Methylation microarray and CNP analysis was carried out.|Most patients (60/61) had a metastatic DedM showing most frequently an unclassified pleomorphic, spindle cell, or small round cell morphology akin to undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma, rarely associated with heterologous elements. Overall, among 20 successfully analysed tissue samples from 16 patients, we found retained melanoma-like MS in only 7 tissue samples while a non-melanoma-like MS was observed in 13 tissue samples. In two patients from whom multiple specimens were analysed, some of the samples had a preserved cutaneous melanoma MS while other specimens exhibited an epigenetic shift towards a mesenchymal/sarcoma-like profile, matching the histological features. In these two patients, CNP was largely identical across all analysed specimens, in line with their common clonal origin, despite significant modification of their epigenome.|Our study further highlights that DedM represents a real diagnostic challenge. While MS and genomic CNP may help pathologists to diagnose DedM, we provide proof-of-concept that dedifferentiation in melanoma is frequently associated with epigenetic modifications.

37102694	<TITLE>A Novel Prognostic Biomarker CCR8 for Gastric Cancer and Anti-CCR8 Blockade Attenuate the Immunosuppressive Capacity of Tregs In Vitro.</TITLE>Objective: To investigate the immunotherapeutic roles and functions of C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 8 (CCR8) molecule in gastric cancer (GC). Materials and Methods: Clinicopathological features of 95 GC cases were collected by a follow-up survey. The expression level of CCR8 was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and analyzed with the cancer genome atlas database. The relationship between CCR8 expression and Clinicopathological features of GC cases was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of cytokines and the proliferation of CD4+ regulator T cells (Tregs) and CD8+ T cells. Results: An upregulated expression of CCR8 in GC tissues was associated with tumor grade, nodal metastasis, and overall survival (OS). Tumor-infiltrated Tregs with higher expression of CCR8 produced more IL10 molecules in vitro. In addition, anti-CCR8 blocking downregulated IL10 expression produced by CD4+ Tregs, and reversed the suppression by Tregs on the secretion and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Conclusion: CCR8 molecule could be a prognostic biomarker for GC cases and a therapeutic target for immune treatments.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37117690	<TITLE>Peptide microarray-based identification of dormancy-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens inducing immune responses among latent tuberculosis infection individuals in Thailand.</TITLE>Multi-stage tuberculosis (TB) vaccines composed of active- and dormancy-associated antigens are promising to trigger the immune protection against all TB stages. However, scientists are still in quest of the suitable vaccine candidates. In this study, we identified the potential targets for this vaccine in a high TB burden country, Thailand. Peptide microarray was applied to gauge IgA and IgG antibodies specific to 16,730 linear epitopes of 52 dormancy-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) proteins in three study groups: active tuberculosis (ATB), latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and endemic healthy control (EHC). Preferential IgA recognition against epitopes of dormancy-associated proteins was identified in LTBI group. Validation of these findings revealed that LTBI subjects exhibited the greater levels of Rv2659c- and Rv1738-specific IgA than those of household contacts, but less than did ATB subjects. Frequencies of IFNγ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced by proteins Rv2659c and Rv1738 were higher in LTBI than ATB individuals. The results indicated that LTBI group in a high TB burden country demonstrated cell-mediated immune response to proteins Rv2659c and Rv1738 stronger than those of ATB. These immune responses likely contribute to natural protection against dormant M. tb and might be potential targets for a multi-stage TB vaccine.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Chiefs of staff answered questions about facility-level POCUS use, training, competency, and policies. Anesthesiology chiefs responded to a follow-up survey with specialty-specific POCUS questions. The results of the 2020 survey were compared with a similar survey conducted by the authors' group in 2015.|All chiefs of staff (n = 130) and 77% of anesthesiology chiefs (n = 96) completed the survey. The most common POCUS applications used were central and peripheral vascular access (69%-72%), peripheral nerve blocks (66%), and evaluation of cardiac function (29%-31%). Compared with 2015, there was a statistically significant increase in desire for training (p = 0.00015), but no significant change in POCUS use (p = 0.31). Training was most desired for volume-status assessment (52%), left ventricular function (47%), pneumothorax (47%), central line placement (40%), peripheral nerve blocks (40%), and pleural effusion (40%). The most common barriers to POCUS use were lack of funding for training (35%), trained providers (33%), and training opportunities (28%).|A significant increase in desire for POCUS training was seen among anesthesiologists practicing in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system since 2015, and lack of training continues to be a top barrier for POCUS use among anesthesiologists.

37141104	<TITLE>Randomized Trial Comparing Left Colon Mucus Production Using Water vs Saline During Water Exchange Colonoscopy.</TITLE>Water-assisted colonoscopy increases left colon mucus production; however, the effect of saline on mucus production is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that saline infusion may reduce mucus production in a dose-related manner.|In a randomized trial, patients were assigned to colonoscopy with CO 2 insufflation, water exchange (WE) with warm water, 25% saline, or 50% saline. The primary outcome was the Left Colon Mucus Scale (LCMS) score (5-point scale). Blood electrolytes were measured before and after saline infusion.|A total of 296 patients with similar baseline demographics were included. The mean LCMS score for WE with water was significantly higher than that for WE with saline and CO 2 (1.4 ± 0.8 [WE water] vs 0.7 ± 0.6 [WE 25% saline] vs 0.5 ± 0.5 [WE 50% saline] vs 0.2 ± 0.4 [CO 2 ]; overall P < 0.0001), with no significant difference between the 25% and 50% saline groups. The left colon adenoma detection rate (ADR) was highest in the 50% saline group, followed by the 25% saline and the water groups (25.0% vs 18.7% vs 13.3%), but the difference was not significant. Logistic regression showed water infusion as the only predictor of moderate mucus production (odds ratio 33.3, 95% confidence interval 7.2-153.2). No acute electrolyte abnormalities were documented indicating a safe modification.|The use of 25% and 50% saline significantly inhibited mucus production and numerically increased ADR in the left colon. Evaluation of the impact of mucus inhibition by saline on ADR may refine the outcomes of WE.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37151508	<TITLE>Chemoenzymatic Preparation of a Campylobacter jejuni Lipid-Linked Heptasaccharide on an Azide-Linked Polyisoprenoid.</TITLE>Complex poly- and oligosaccharides on the surface of bacteria provide a unique fingerprint to different strains of pathogenic and symbiotic microbes that could be exploited for therapeutics or sensors selective for specific glycans. To discover reagents that can selectively interact with specific bacterial glycans, a system for both the chemoenzymatic preparation and immobilization of these materials would be ideal. Bacterial glycans are typically synthesized in nature on the C55 polyisoprenoid bactoprenyl (or undecaprenyl) phosphate. However, this long-chain isoprenoid can be difficult to work with in vitro. Here, we describe the addition of a chemically functional benzylazide tag to polyisoprenoids. We have found that both the organic-soluble and water-soluble benzylazide isoprenoid can serve as a substrate for the well-characterized system responsible for Campylobacter jejuni N-linked heptasaccharide assembly. Using the organic-soluble analogue, we demonstrate the use of an N-acetyl-glucosamine epimerase that can be used to lower the cost of glycan assembly, and using the water-soluble analogue, we demonstrate the immobilization of the C. jejuni heptasaccharide on magnetic beads. These conjugated beads are then shown to interact with soybean agglutinin, a lectin known to interact with N-acetyl-galactosamine in the C. jejuni heptasaccharide. The methods provided could be used for a wide variety of applications including the discovery of new glycan-interacting partners.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37166553	<TITLE>Clinical application of spinal robot in cervical spine surgery: safety and accuracy of posterior pedicle screw placement in comparison with conventional freehand methods.</TITLE>The novel robot-assisted (RA) technique has been utilized increasingly to improve the accuracy of cervical pedicle screw placement. Although the clinical application of the RA technique has been investigated in several case series and comparative studies, the superiority and safety of RA over conventional freehand (FH) methods remain controversial. Meanwhile, the intra-pedicular accuracy of the two methods has not been compared for patients with cervical traumatic conditions. This study aimed to compare the rate and risk factors of intra-pedicular accuracy of RA versus the conventional FH approach for posterior pedicle screw placement in cervical traumatic diseases. A total of 52 patients with cervical traumatic diseases who received cervical screw placement using RA (26 patients) and FH (26 patients) techniques were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the intra-pedicular accuracy of cervical pedicle screw placement according to the Gertzbin-Robbins scale. Secondary outcome parameters included surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, postoperative hospital stay, and complications. Moreover, the risk factors that possibly affected intra-pedicular accuracy were assessed using univariate analyses. Out of 52 screws inserted using the RA method, 43 screws (82.7%) were classified as grade A, with the remaining 7 (13.5%) and 2 (3.8%) screws classified as grades B and C. In the FH cohort, 60.8% of the 79 screws were graded A, with the remaining screws graded B (21, 26.6%), C (8, 10.1%), and D (2, 2.5%). The RA technique showed a significantly higher rate of optimal intra-pedicular accuracy than the FH method (P = 0.008), but there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of clinically acceptable accuracy (P = 0.161). Besides, the RA technique showed remarkably longer surgery time, less postoperative drainage, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and equivalent intraoperative blood loss and complications than the FH technique. Furthermore, the univariate analyses showed that severe obliquity of the lateral atlantoaxial joint in the coronal plane (P = 0.003) and shorter width of the lateral mass at the inferior margin of the posterior arch (P = 0.014) were risk factors related to the inaccuracy of C1 screw placement. The diagnosis of HRVA (P < 0.001), severe obliquity of the lateral atlantoaxial joint in the coronal plane (P < 0.001), short pedicle width (P < 0.001), and short pedicle height (P < 0.001) were risk factors related to the inaccuracy of C2 screw placement. RA cervical pedicle screw placement was associated with a higher rate of optimal intra-pedicular accuracy to the FH technique for patients with cervical traumatic conditions. The severe obliquity of the lateral atlantoaxial joint in the coronal plane independently contributed to high rates of the inaccuracy of C1 and C2 screw placements. RA pedicle screw placement is safe and useful for cervical traumatic surgery.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37296536	<TITLE>Current Treatment of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux.</TITLE>Objectives: Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a complex syndrome characterized by the reflux of gastroduodenal contents into the pharynx or larynx, resulting in a range of symptoms, including chronic cough, throat clearing, pain, dysphagia, hoarseness, and dysphonia. Despite the lack of a gold standard for diagnosis or treatment, various strategies have been proposed to manage LPR. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is compromised by the lack of a uniform treatment protocol, which places a burden on patients, physicians, and the healthcare system. This study aims to systematically review the treatments of LPR and provide updated and useful clinical information to clinical physicians. Methods: The literature with an emphasis on LPR and related keywords is searched and reviewed in PubMed. Results: Treatment of LPR includes health education, lifestyle modification, dietary changes, medications, and surgery, as well as the emergence of a novel treatment method involving external upper esophageal sphincter compression devices. Conclusions: Currently, medication is the main treatment, supplemented with lifestyle and dietary changes, but there is still a lack of effective means for patients with drug-resistant or intolerant LPR. More high-quality and rigorous trials must continue to be conducted to determine the best treatment options and find novel treatments. Taking into account the complexity of LPR, this study proposes a simple algorithm to help clinicians with the initial management of this disease.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Each model demonstrated a good match with the R2 values for TPC (0.9808), DPPH (0.9583), and FRAP (0.7872). The combination of a mixture of water (0.409), acetone (0.307), and methanol (0.284) with a desirability level of 0.723, resulted in a TPC of 34.112 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight (DW), DPPH of 26.533 μmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/g DW, and FRAP of 92.353 μmol TE/g DW. This showed a high extraction efficiency which was optimal.|The best condition to extract the rhizomes of C. xanthorrhiza was a ternary combination of solvents including water, acetone, and methanol in the proportions of 0.409, 0.307, and 0.284, respectively, with a desirability level of 0.723.

37338346	<TITLE>Design, Screening, and Characterization of Engineered Phage Endolysins with Extracellular Antibacterial Activity against Gram-Negative Bacteria.</TITLE>Phage-encoded endolysins are emerging antibacterial agents based on their ability to efficiently degrade peptidoglycan on Gram-positive bacteria, but the envelope characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria limit their application. Engineering modifications of endolysins can improve the optimization of their penetrative and antibacterial properties. This study constructed a screening platform to screen for engineered Artificial-Bp7e (Art-Bp7e) endolysins with extracellular antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. An oligonucleotide of 20 repeated NNK codons was inserted upstream of the endolysin gene Bp7e to construct a chimeric endolysin library in the pColdTF vector. The chimeric Art-Bp7e proteins were expressed by transforming the plasmid library into E. coli BL21 and released by chloroform fumigation, and the protein activities were evaluated by the spotting method and the colony-counting method to screen for promising proteins. Sequence analysis showed that all screened proteins with extracellular activities had a chimeric peptide with a positive charge and an α-helical structure. Also, a representative protein, Art-Bp7e6, was further characterized. It exhibited broad antibacterial activity against E. coli (7/21), Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (4/10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/10), and even Staphylococcus aureus (1/10). In the transmembrane process, the chimeric peptide of Art-Bp7e6 depolarized the host cell envelope, increased the permeability of the cell, and facilitated the movement of Art-Bp7e6 across the envelope to hydrolyze the peptidoglycan. In conclusion, the screening platform successfully screened for chimeric endolysins with extracellular antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria, which provides methodological support for the further screening of engineered endolysins with high extracellular activities against Gram-negative bacteria. Also, the established platform showed broad application prospects and can be used to screen various proteins. IMPORTANCE The presence of the envelope in Gram-negative bacteria limits the use of phage endolysins, and engineering endolysins is an efficient way to optimize their penetrative and antibacterial properties. We built a platform for endolysin engineering and screening. A random peptide was fused with the phage endolysin Bp7e to construct a chimeric endolysin library, and engineered Artificial-Bp7e (Art-Bp7e) endolysins with extracellular activity against Gram-negative bacteria were successfully screened from the library. The purposeful Art-Bp7e had a chimeric peptide with an abundant positive charge and an α-helical structure, which led Bp7e to acquire the ability for the extracellular lysis of Gram-negative bacteria and showed a broad lysis spectrum. The platform provides a huge library capacity without the limitations of reported proteins or peptides. It can be utilized for the further screening of optimal endolysins against Gram-negative bacteria as well as for the screening of additional proteins with specific modifications.

Protein-energy malnutrition, anemia, and vitamin deficiencies are major public health problems. Hunger is exacerbated by an annual locust invasion. The current policy of large-scale government spraying of pesticides from planes is logistically complex, costly, and damaging to the environment.|Our research aimed to study the feasibility of turning the locust invasion into a protein-rich food supply for families and an economic opportunity for youth.|We conducted 20 focus group discussions (FGDs) with females and males aged 18-24 and 25 years or older and with female artisans in 6 swarm communes in Madagascar's south to understand enablers and barriers to collection, preparation, and consumption of locusts.|Enablers include consumption by all ages in Antandroy culture and perception of locusts as a delicacy, tasty, and free. Family members have different roles in the collection and preparation of locusts. Local technologies for mass collection include digging trenches in fields and entrapment via sisal netting.

37348508	<TITLE>PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint pathway regulates hippocampal neuronal excitability and learning and memory behavior.</TITLE>Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 constitute an immune checkpoint pathway. We report that neuronal PD-1 signaling regulates learning/memory in health and disease. Mice lacking PD-1 (encoded by Pdcd1) exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Intraventricular administration of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody (RMP1-14) potentiated learning and memory. Selective deletion of PD-1 in excitatory neurons (but not microglia) also enhances LTP and memory. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impairs learning and memory, which is rescued by Pdcd1 deletion or intraventricular PD-1 blockade. Conversely, re-expression of Pdcd1 in PD-1-deficient hippocampal neurons suppresses memory and LTP. Exogenous PD-L1 suppresses learning/memory in mice and the excitability of mouse and NHP hippocampal neurons through PD-1. Notably, neuronal activation suppresses PD-L1 secretion, and PD-L1/PD-1 signaling is distinctly regulated by learning and TBI. Thus, conditions that reduce PD-L1 levels or PD-1 signaling could promote memory in both physiological and pathological conditions.

Here, using in vivo model, we found that combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD caused hippocampal neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits in offspring. MeRIP-seq revealed m6A level of Rhoa, a regulatory gene of cellular senescence, was significantly increased in combined environmental Cd and HFD-treated paternal sperm. Interestingly, combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD markedly enhanced Rhoa mRNA, its m6A and reader protein IGF2BP1 in offspring hippocampus. STM2457, the inhibitor of m6A modification, markedly mitigated paternal exposure-caused the elevation of hippocampal Rhoa m6A, neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits in offspring. In vitro experiments, Rhoa siR significantly reversed mouse hippocampal neuronal senescence. Igf2bp1 siR obviously reduced the level and stability of Rhoa in aging mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. In conclusion, combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD induce offspring hippocampal neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits by promoting IGF2BP1-mediated Rhoa stabilization in offspring hippocampus via elevating Rhoa m6A in paternal sperm.

37374007	<TITLE>Cross Sectional Analysis of Eurasian Skull Anatomy for 3D Cephalometry-Normative Data Reveal Four Different Skull Types.</TITLE>The unsolved problem in three-dimensional surgical planning for patients with facial deformity, dysgnathia, or asymmetry is the lack of a normative database of "norm skulls" that can be used as treatment objectives. A study was conducted on 90 Eurasian persons (46 male and 44 female adults) for whom cone beam-computed tomography images were available. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with a skeletal Class I pattern, proper interincisal relationship with normal occlusion, the absence of an open bite both in the anterior and posterior region, and a normal and balanced facial appearance; patients with dysgnathia and malformations were excluded. A total of 18 landmarks were digitized and 3D cephalometric measurements were performed and analyzed by means of proportions calculated from the landmarks. Male and female skulls were analyzed, as well as subdivisions revealed by cluster analysis. The data showed that four subtypes of skulls were distinguishable with statistical significance (p < 0.05). A male and a female type subdivided in a brachiocephalic and dolichocephalic phenotype could be identified. For each type, a mean shape was calculated by a Procrustes transformation, which, in turn, was used to create four template skulls from a male and a female skull. This was accomplished by fitting the polygon models of the two skulls to each of the two subtypes based on the landmarks marked on them using a thin plate spline transformation. The normative data of the subtypes can individually serve as a guide for orthodontic surgery in the Eurasian population, which is especially helpful in 3D planning and the execution of craniofacial operations.

37377402	<TITLE>Safety and immunogenicity of a third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine among cancer patients.</TITLE>Compared to the general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The immune response to a two-dose regimen of mRNA vaccines in cancer patients is generally lower than in immunocompetent individuals. Booster doses may meaningfully augment immune response in this population. We conducted an observational study with the primary objective of determining the immunogenicity of vaccine dose three (100 μg) of mRNA-1273 among cancer patients and a secondary objective of evaluating safety at 14 and 28 days.|The mRNA-1273 vaccine was administered ∼7 to 9 months after administering two vaccine doses (i.e., the primary series). Immune responses (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) were assessed 28 days post-dose three. Adverse events were collected at days 14 (± 5) and 28 (+5) post-dose three. Fisher exact or X2 tests were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates, and paired t-tests were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) across different time intervals.|Among 284 adults diagnosed with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies, dose three of mRNA-1273 increased the percentage of patients seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody from 81.7% pre-dose three to 94.4% 28 days post-dose three. GMTs increased 19.0-fold (15.8-22.8). Patients with lymphoid cancers or solid tumors had the lowest and highest antibody titers post-dose three, respectively. Antibody responses after dose three were reduced among those who received anti-CD20 antibody treatment, had lower total lymphocyte counts and received anticancer therapy within 3 months. Among patients seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibody pre-dose three, 69.2% seroconverted after dose three. A majority (70.4%) experienced mostly mild, transient adverse reactions within 14 days of dose three, whereas severe treatment-emergent events within 28 days were very rare (<2%).|Dose three of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was well-tolerated and augmented SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in cancer patients, especially those who did not seroconvert post-dose two or whose GMTs significantly waned post-dose two. Lymphoid cancer patients experienced lower humoral responses to dose three of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, suggesting that timely access to boosters is important for this population.

Our study was to reveal the association between the amount of correction and PJK according to UIV levels.|Adult spinal deformity patients aged >50 years who underwent thoracolumbar fusion (≥4 levels) were included. PJK was defined by proximal junctional angles ≥15°. Presumed demographic and radiographic risk factors for PJK were evaluated including parameters regarding the correction amount such as postoperative change in lumbar lordosis and postoperative offset grouping, the value associated with age-adjusted pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch. The patients were divided according to UIV levels of T10 or above (group A) and T11 or below (group B). Multivariate analyses were performed separately for both groups.|The present study included 241 patients (74 for group A and 167 for group B). PJK developed in approximately half of all patients within an average of 5 years of follow-up. For group A, only body mass index (P = 0.002) was associated with PJK. No radiographic parameters were correlated. For group B, postoperative change in lumbar lordosis (P = 0.009) and offset value (P = 0.030) were significant risk factors for PJK development.|The correction amount of sagittal deformity increased the risk of PJK only in patients with UIV at or below T11. However, it was not associated with PJK development in patients with UIV at or above T10.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37411028	<TITLE>Closing the Diagnostic Gap in Adolescents and Young Adult Women With Bleeding Disorders: Missed Opportunities.</TITLE>Approximately 2% of the general population have an underlying inherited bleeding disorder, which, for adolescents and young adult women, has both physical risks and adverse psychosocial effects. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be the first sign of an underlying bleeding disorder such as von Willebrand disease and the X-linked bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B. Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in particular the hypermobile subtype, are relatively frequent in the general population and can also cause bleeding symptoms from impaired hemostasis due to defective collagen. For more than 20 years, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended screening adolescents and young adult women for bleeding disorders when they present with heavy menstrual bleeding. Despite this directive, there is a significant gap from symptom onset to time of diagnosis in this patient population. We must work to effectively close this diagnostic gap by consistently obtaining thorough bleeding histories, performing the appropriate laboratory evaluations, working collaboratively with hematologists, and using tools and materials promoted by ACOG. Improved screening and earlier diagnosis of these individuals can have far-reaching effects that are not limited to heavy menstrual bleeding management and extend to peripartum considerations and prenatal counseling.

37447307	<TITLE>Eight-Day Fast and a Single Bout of Exercise: The Effect on Serum Methylarginines and Amino Acids in Men.</TITLE>Changes in serum concentration of methylarginines and amino acids after exercise are well documented, whereas the effects of exercise applied together with fasting are still debated and not thoroughly studied. Thus, we hypothesised that alterations in methylarginines such as ADMA, SDMA and L-NMMA might be responsible for decreased exercise performance after 8 days of fasting. Additionally, we propose that conditions in which the human body is exposed to prolonged fasting for more than a week elicit a distinctly different response to exercise than after overnight fasting. A group of 10 healthy men with previous fasting experience participated in the study. The exercise test was performed until exhaustion with a gradually increasing intensity before and after the 8-day fast. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after exercise. ADMA, SDMA, L-NMMA, dimethylamine and amino acids were analysed in serum samples by ID-LC-MS/MS. SDMA, L-NMMA and dimethylamine significantly decreased after 8 days of fasting, whereas ADMA did not change. BCAA, Phe, alanine and some other amino acids increased after fasting. Exercise-induced changes in amino acids were distinct after an 8-day fast compared to overnight fasting. A decrease in physical performance accompanied all of these alterations. In conclusion, our data indicate that neither methyl-arginine changes nor the Trp/BCAA ratio can explain exercise-induced fatigue after fasting. However, the observed decrease in hArg concentration suggests the limited synthesis of creatine, possibly contributing to reduced physical performance.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37530103	<TITLE>Connecting groups and behaviours: A network analysis of identity-infused behaviours.</TITLE>Research in the social identity tradition acknowledges the multiplicity of our identities and the implications that identity compatibility has for our health and well-being. However, current measures of multiple group membership have not yet captured the richness and complexity of our social identity networks at the wider sample level, and data regarding the different behaviours typically associated with different group memberships are scarce. Adopting a network approach, we explore the co-occurrence of different group memberships within an individual (identity-by-identity network), the behaviours that are shared among identities (behaviour-by-identity network), and whether identities that are shared also share common behaviours (identity-by-behaviour network). An online survey asked participants (N = 286) to list the groups they are part of, as well as the behaviours viewed to be typical of group members. The networks identified several identities and behaviours to significantly co-occur at a rate both higher and lower than chance. Networks were found to be low in modularity; there was no evidence of clustering within the data. Permutation analyses demonstrated the overall structure of the networks to be significantly different than expected by chance. The co-occurrences identified serve as a meaningful resource for those conducting research into identities, group norms and their associated behaviours.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37544280	<TITLE>Gliptins normalize posttraumatic hippocampal neurogenesis and restore cognitive function after controlled cortical impact on sensorimotor cortex.</TITLE>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to long-term neurocognitive dysfunctions. Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) serves critical functions in cognition but can be disrupted by brain injury and insult in serval forms. In the present study, we explore the cellular and molecular targets of DPP-4 inhibitors (or gliptins) as related to hippocampal function and TBI cognitive sequelae. Two structurally different gliptins, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, were examined using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of moderate TBI in mice. Sensorimotor CCI, although distal from the hippocampus, impaired hippocampal-dependent cognition without obvious hippocampal tissue destruction. Neurogenic cell proliferation in the DG was increased accompanied by large numbers of reactive astrocyte. Increased numbers of immature granule cells with abnormal dendritic outgrowth were ectopically localized in the outer granule cell layer (GCL) and hilus. Long-term potentiation of dentate immature granule cells was also impaired. Both sitagliptin and vildagliptin attenuated the CCI-induced ectopic migration of doublecortin-positive immature neurons into the outer GCL and hilus, restored the normal dendritic branching pattern of the immature neurons and prevented astrocyte reactivation. Both gliptins prevented loss of normal synaptic integration in the DG after sensorimotor CCI and improved cognitive behavior. Sensorimotor cortical injury thus results in an abnormal neurogenesis pattern and astrocyte reactivation in the distal hippocampus which appears to contribute to the development of cognitive dysfunction after TBI. DPP-4 inhibitors prevent astrocyte reactivation, normalize the posttraumatic hippocampal neurogenesis and help to maintain normal electrophysiology in the DG with positive behavioral effect in a mouse model.

37597367	<TITLE>Seawater as supplemental moisture: The effect of Co-hydrothermal carbonization products obtained from chicken manure and cornstalk.</TITLE>The use of seawater as a substitute for pure water as supplemental moisture raises questions about its effect on the physicochemical properties of hydrochar. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using seawater as supplemental moisture by comparing the physicochemical properties of products obtained through Co-hydrothermal carbonization of chicken manure and cornstalk under seawater and deionized water conditions. By varying the HTC temperature and blending ratios of CM and CS to investigate comprehensively the effect of seawater. Results indicated that the hydrochar yield experienced a variation from 54.54% to 57.40%, while the IC value changed from 7.69% to 8.46% as the ratio of CM:CS shifted from 3:1 to 1:3 under seawater conditions. The higher heating value of the hydrochars obtained under seawater conditions was lower than those obtained under deionized water conditions. This suggests that seawater conditions promote the hydrolysis reaction of organic solid waste. Furthermore, it was observed that when no lignin hydrolysis reaction occurred, seawater conditions had no discernible effect on the fuel quality of the hydrochar. However, at an HTC temperature of 250 °C, the fuel quality of the hydrochar obtained under seawater conditions was notably inferior to that of the hydrochar obtained under deionized water. Thus, an HTC temperature lower than 250 °C is necessary for the hydrothermal carbonization of organic solid waste under seawater conditions. Moreover, the relative content of surface -C-(C, H)/CC of the hydrochar obtained under seawater conditions was lower than that obtained under deionized water conditions, indicating that the hydrochar had a low degree of aromatization. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the immobilized Mg atoms in the hydrochar under seawater conditions, which affected the hydrochar yield and higher heating value of the hydrochar. This research presents a theoretical foundation for preparing solid fuels and materials using hydrothermal carbonization of saltwater as supplemental moisture.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

Lactobacillus rhamnosus extracts were obtained via ultrasonic crushing and ultracentrifugation. The effects of the LGG extract on osteoclast differentiation were evaluated, and the related signaling pathways were examined using western blotting. A mouse periodontitis model was established, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus extract was injected into the gingival sulcus to evaluate the inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus extract on alveolar bone resorption.|At 50 μg/mL, Lactobacillus rhamnosus extract inhibited osteoclast differentiation with no effect on apoptosis and proliferation. This phenomenon was achieved by deactivating the NF-κB/c-Fos/NFATc1 signaling pathway through toll-like receptor 2. The in vivo results showed that the local injection of Lactobacillus rhamnosus extract suppressed osteoclast differentiation and alveolar bone resorption.|The ultrasonicated extract of Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited osteoclast differentiation by suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/c-Fos/NFATc1 pathway. Furthermore, it inhibited the destruction of the alveolar bone, providing a new strategy for the use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontitis.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo

This study aimed to determine how the presence of ILE officials affects patient care and provider experience in a teaching hospital setting.|This cross-sectional online survey solicited quantitative and qualitative feedback from medical students, residents, and attending physicians (n = 1364) at a teaching hospital system with two campuses in Arizona. The survey included participant demographics and addressed participants' experience caring for patients in ILE custody, including the perception of respect, violations of patients' privacy and autonomy, and the comfort level with understanding hospital policies and patient rights. Thematic analyses were also performed based on respondent comments.|332 individuals (24%) responded to the survey. Quantitative analyses revealed that 14% of participants described disrespectful behaviors of ILE officials, mainly toward detained patients. Qualitative thematic analyses of respondent comments revealed details on such disrespectful encounters including ILE officers violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and using intimidation tactics with patients. Nearly half of the respondents did not have knowledge of policies about ILE detainees' medical care, detainees' privacy rights, or ILE's authority in patient care.|This study points out the complexities, challenges, and ethical considerations of caring for patients in ILE custody in the hospital setting and the need to educate healthcare professionals on both patient and provider rights. It describes the lived experiences and difficulties that providers on the border face in trying to achieve equity in the care they provide to detained migrant patients.

This paper assesses the disparity in spectrum of infectious diseases between two groups, and described disparity's variation by age, year and province, and determined the priority diseases.|A total of 7,912,274 new incident cases (6,159,021 in school and 1,753,253 out of school) aged 6-21 years across 43 notifiable infectious diseases have been collected based on China's Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System from 2013 to 2021. All infectious diseases are categorized into seven categories: vaccine preventable, bacteria, gastrointestinal and enterovirus, sexually transmitted and bloodborne, vectorborne, zoonotic, and quarantinable diseases. We used the index of incidence rate ratio (IRR) of by specific disease, category, year, and age to assess the disparity between those out-of-school and in-school, and determine their separate priority diseases.|From 2013 to 2021, a small disparity of notifiable infectious diseases existed with higher average yearly incidence for out-of-school children, adolescents, and youth than that in-school (327.601 v.s. 319.677 per 100,000, IRR = 1.025, 95%CI: 1.023-1.027, standardized IRR = 1.169, 95%CI: 1.155-1.183), and it gradually narrowed by surveillance years with IRR from 1.351 in 2013 to 1.015 in 2021 due to large decreased disparity in compulsory education stage group. Such disparity was mainly driven by sexually transmitted and bloodborne diseases, bacteria diseases, vectorborne diseases, quarantinable diseases and zoonotic diseases. However, vaccine preventable diseases, gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases showed higher incidence of infectious diseases for those in-school than that out-of-school, particularly for seasonal influenza, mumps and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Meanwhile, such disparity is obvious in most of ages and in eastern and coastal regions of China, and the narrowing trend is attributed to six categories diseases, except for sexually transmitted and bloodborne diseases with gradually widened disparity between two groups with surveillance years with IRR from 22.939 in 2013 to 23.291 in 2021 due to large disparity for those who have completed compulsory education.|A huge achievement has been achieved in reducing the burden and disparity of infectious diseases between out-of-school and in-school children, adolescents, and youths in China, particularly for the compulsory education stage population. The priorities for the coming decades will be to extend successful strategies to a broad scope and promote education, particularly for the investment of social health resources and the improvement of personal health literacy in the non-compulsory education stage. This should involve extending the years of compulsory school, improving sex health education, strengthening monitoring, expanding immunization programs coverage and prioritizing the prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis among out-of-school population.|National Natural Science Foundation of China and Beijing Natural Science Foundation.

37841448	<TITLE>Sex difference in cardiac performance in individuals with irregular shift work.</TITLE>Background: sex differences existed in animal behavioral adaption and activity rhythms when exposed to chronic disruption of the circadian rhythm. Whether these differences extend to cardiac performance has not been fully investigated by cardiac imaging technology.|One hundred and thirty patients enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into the day shift (DS) group and the irregular shift (IRS) group based on whether involved in the night shift and the frequency of the night shift. Comparisons of clinical data and cardiac imaging parameters were performed to identify the sex difference in cardiac function in the participants with day shift work or irregular shifts.|The absolute value of GLS was significantly lower in male IRS group than in male DS group. In females, no significant difference was tested in left ventricular function between the two groups. In male participants, Weekly work hours (WWH) was positively correlated with HR (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) and QTc duration (r = 0.68, p < 0.00), and weakly negatively correlated with the GLS (r = -0.38, p = 0.05). Amongst patients, there was a 2.67-fold higher relative risk (RR) for impaired GLS in males than in females, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 1.20-5.61. Moreover, there was an increased risk in the male IRS group compared to the female IRS group to develop impaired GLS (RR:3.14, 95 % CI 1.20-7.84).|The present study suggests that chronic circadian disruption brings cardiac dysfunction in people with night-shift work.

37851044	<TITLE>Multidisciplinary Clinics in Neuromuscular Medicine.</TITLE>Multidisciplinary care is comprehensive, coordinated clinical care across medical disciplines and allied health professions. Neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophies, are often associated with disabling weakness and extramuscular symptoms and may benefit from care in a model that consolidates numerous clinic visits into a single more efficient multidisciplinary clinic visit. The goal of the neuromuscular multidisciplinary care model is to improve patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, quality of life, access to medications and equipment, and survival. Although the costs of running a multidisciplinary clinic are high, they are likely associated with cost savings from the patient's perspective. Several barriers to acceptance of multidisciplinary clinics include the distance needed to travel to the clinic and the duration of the clinic visit. Telehealth multidisciplinary clinic visits may address some of these concerns. Further study is needed to understand the value of multidisciplinary clinics and is a necessary step toward creating a sustainable model.	No specific gene was perturbed in vivo
37872767	<TITLE>The Molecular Circadian Clock Is a Target of Anti-cancer Translation Inhibitors.</TITLE>Circadian-paced biological processes are key to physiology and required for metabolic, immunologic, and cardiovascular homeostasis. Core circadian clock components are transcription factors whose half-life is precisely regulated, thereby controlling the intrinsic cellular circadian clock. Genetic disruption of molecular clock components generally leads to marked pathological events phenotypically affecting behavior and multiple aspects of physiology. Using a transcriptional signature similarity approach, we identified anti-cancer protein synthesis inhibitors as potent modulators of the cardiomyocyte molecular clock. Eukaryotic protein translation inhibitors, ranging from translation initiation (rocaglates, 4-EGI1, etc.) to ribosomal elongation inhibitors (homoharringtonine, puromycin, etc.), were found to potently ablate protein abundance of REV-ERBα, a repressive nuclear receptor and component of the molecular clock. These inhibitory effects were observed both in vitro and in vivo and could be extended to PER2, another component of the molecular clock. Taken together, our observations suggest that the activity spectrum of protein synthesis inhibitors, whose clinical use is contemplated not only in cancers but also in viral infections, must be extended to circadian rhythm disruption, with potential beneficial or iatrogenic effects upon acute or prolonged administration.

37874706	<TITLE>Training with Uncertain Annotations for Semantic Segmentation of Basal Cell Carcinoma from Full-Field OCT Images.</TITLE>Semantic segmentation of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) images of human skin has received considerable attention in medical imaging. However, it is challenging for dermatopathologists to annotate the training data due to OCT's lack of color specificity. Very often, they are uncertain about the correctness of the annotations they made. In practice, annotations fraught with uncertainty profoundly impact the effectiveness of model training and hence the performance of BCC segmentation. To address this issue, we propose an approach to model training with uncertain annotations. The proposed approach includes a data selection strategy to mitigate the uncertainty of training data, a class expansion to consider sebaceous gland and hair follicle as additional classes to enhance the performance of BCC segmentation, and a self-supervised pre-training procedure to improve the initial weights of the segmentation model parameters. Furthermore, we develop three post-processing techniques to reduce the impact of speckle noise and image discontinuities on BCC segmentation. The mean Dice score of BCC of our model reaches 0.503±0.003, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best performance to date for semantic segmentation of BCC from FF-OCT images.

Here, a porous cationic biopolymeric scaffold (CSC-g-nHAp) with microenvironment self-regulating ability was synthesized by chitosan-catechol chelating the Ca2+ of nanohydroxyapatite and bonding type I collagen. Chitosan-catechol's inherent antibacterial and antioxidant abilities endowed this scaffold with desirable abilities to eliminate periodontal pathogen infection and maintain homeostatic balances between free radical generation and elimination. Meanwhile, this scaffold promoted rat bone marrow stromal cells' osteogenic differentiation and achieved significant ectopic mineralization after 4 weeks of subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Moreover, after 8 weeks of implantation in the rat critical-sized periodontal bone defect model, CSC-g-nHAp conferred 5.5-fold greater alveolar bone regeneration than the untreated group. This cationic biopolymeric scaffold could regulate the local microenvironment through the synergistic effects of its antibacterial, antioxidant, and osteoconductive activities to promote solid periodontal bone regeneration.

37972247	<TITLE>Divergence in the Saccharomyces Species' Heat Shock Response Is Indicative of Their Thermal Tolerance.</TITLE>The Saccharomyces species have diverged in their thermal growth profile. Both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus grow at temperatures well above the maximum growth temperature of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces uvarum but grow more poorly at lower temperatures. In response to thermal shifts, organisms activate a stress response that includes heat shock proteins involved in protein homeostasis and acquisition of thermal tolerance. To determine whether Saccharomyces species have diverged in their response to temperature, we measured changes in gene expression in response to a 12 °C increase or decrease in temperature for four Saccharomyces species and their six pairwise hybrids. To ensure coverage of subtelomeric gene families, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated a complete S. uvarum genome. In response to heat, the cryophilic species showed a stronger stress response than the thermophilic species, and the hybrids showed a mixture of parental responses that depended on the time point. After an initial strong response indicative of high thermal stress, hybrids with a thermophilic parent resolved their heat shock response to become similar to their thermophilic parent. Within the hybrids, only a small number of temperature-responsive genes showed consistent differences between alleles from the thermophilic and cryophilic species. Our results show that divergence in the heat shock response is mainly a consequence of a strain's thermal tolerance, suggesting that cellular factors that signal heat stress or resolve heat-induced changes are relevant to thermal divergence in the Saccharomyces species.

38019198	<TITLE>Bridging the Gaps in Meta-Omic Analysis: Workflows and Reproducibility.</TITLE>The past few years have seen significant advances in the study of complex microbial communities associated with the evolution of sequencing technologies and increasing adoption of whole genome shotgun sequencing methods over the once more traditional Amplicon-based methods. Although these advances have broadened the horizon of meta-omic analyses in planetary health, human health, and ecology from simple sample composition studies to comprehensive taxonomic and metabolic profiles, there are still significant challenges in processing these data. First, there is a widespread lack of standardization in data processing, including software choices and the ease of installing and running attendant software. This can lead to several inconsistencies, making comparing results across studies and reproducing original results difficult. We argue that these drawbacks are especially evident in metatranscriptomic analysis, with most analyses relying on ad hoc scripts instead of pipelines implemented in workflow managers. Additional challenges rely on integrating meta-omic data, since methods have to consider the biases in the library preparation and sequencing methods and the technical noise that can arise from it. Here, we critically discuss the current limitations in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics methods with a view to catalyze future innovations in the field of Planetary Health, ecology, and allied fields of life sciences. We highlight possible solutions for these constraints to bring about more standardization, with ease of installation, high performance, and reproducibility as guiding principles.

38027494	<TITLE>Loss of ASD-related molecule Cntnap2 affects colonic motility in mice.</TITLE>Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are highly prevalent among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the molecular link between ASD and GI dysfunction remains poorly understood. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is critical for normal GI motility and has been shown to be altered in mouse models of ASD and other neurological disorders. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2) is an ASD-related synaptic cell-adhesion molecule important for sensory processing. In this study, we examine the role of Cntnap2 in GI motility by characterizing Cntnap2's expression in the ENS and assessing GI function in Cntnap2 mutant mice. We find Cntnap2 expression predominately in enteric sensory neurons. We further assess in vivo and ex vivo GI motility in Cntnap2 mutants and show altered transit time and colonic motility patterns. The overall organization of the ENS appears undisturbed. Our results suggest that Cntnap2 plays a role in GI function and may provide a molecular link between ASD and GI dysfunction.

38083743	<TITLE>X-RIM: Extreme Recurrent Independent Mechanisms for Noise-resistant and Interpretable Stroke Risk Prediction.</TITLE>Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. An accurate stroke risk prediction is crucial for its early detection and prevention. Using deep learning to exploit patients' time-series electronic health records (EHRs) has been shown as a promising and efficient solution for such a prediction. Although time-series data could be more informative than a single cross-section in time, real-world time-series EHRs usually have a significantly high missing rate due to irregular patient visits. This could undermine sequential data's benefits unless a proper deep-learning model design is adopted. Furthermore, deep models have long been challenged for their interpretability, which is especially crucial for medical applications. In this study, we propose an extreme design based on the concept of recurrent independent mechanisms (RIM), termed extreme RIM (X-RIM). With no need for imputation, X-RIM utilizes the information of each input feature's temporal records through independent recurrent modules. Experiments on real-world data from the National Taiwan University Hospital showed that, in terms of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC), and Youden Index, X-RIM (AUPRC: 0.210; AUROC: 0.764; Youden: 0.373) outperformed the classic risk score CHA2DS2-VASc (AUPRC: 0.103; AUROC: 0.650; Youden: 0.223) and other benchmarks in stroke risk prediction. Additional experiments also indicate that individual feature contributions to a prediction could be evaluated intuitively under X-RIM's independent structure to enhance interpretability.
